**Friend of Defenders,**

Imagine a moment where a newborn polar bear cub, just one pound at birth, relies entirely on its mother for survival. This little life is vulnerable, facing a world that threatens its existence. The Southern Beaufort Sea population of polar bears, once thriving, now numbers just 900 individualsâ€”a stark reminder of the delicate balance disrupted by climate change and habitat loss.

Polar Bears Rescue by University of Sheffield is at the forefront of this urgent struggle. Our work is crucial in protecting these resilient creatures, yet we need your support to ensure their survival. The Arctic Refuge, where many polar bears call home, is under threat from industrial development. Seismic exploration alone could crush their precious snow caves, leaving these bears with no safe haven.

This is not a time for inaction. The Southern Beaufort Sea population is in freefall, and every day brings another risk to their survival. Your contribution can make a world of difference. Donate today to support our efforts and help safeguard these remarkable animals.

**How You Can Help:**
- **Support Our Work:** Donate to Polar Bears Rescue by University of Sheffield and help protect these resilient creatures.
- **Join Our Team:** Volunteer for impactful projects, from fundraising to community advocacy, and be part of the change.
- **Spread the Word:** Share our story with others, encouraging them to take action and become a hero in the fight for polar bears.

Your generosity will empower us to keep these bears safe and ensure their populations recover. Together, we can turn the tide and secure a future where polar bears thrive.

**Thank you for being a friend of the polar bears.**

Sincerely,

[Your Name]  
[Your Position]
