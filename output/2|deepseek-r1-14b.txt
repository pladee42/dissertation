**Subject Line:** Help Save Polar Bears: Your Immediate Action is Needed

**Greeting:** Defender,

**Opening Paragraph:** The survival of polar bears is on the line. With their habitats melting at an alarming rate and threats from industrial expansion, these magnificent creatures are fighting for their lives. The University of Sheffield’s Polar Bears Rescue team is doing everything we can, but we need your urgent support to protect them.

**Body Paragraph:**  
The Arctic is under siege. Rising temperatures are destroying the sea ice that polar bears rely on for survival. Meanwhile, Big Oil is pushing to industrialize the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which is a critical denning ground for polar bears. This would disrupt their habitats, disturb their feeding patterns, and put their survival at even greater risk.

At the University of Sheffield, we’ve been working tirelessly to protect polar bears through research, conservation, and advocacy. But we can’t do it alone. We need your help to amplify our efforts and stand against those who prioritize profit over the environment.

**Call to Action:**  
We need you to take action right now. Urge your elected officials to support the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, which would protect polar bear denning areas from industrial activities. Your voice is crucial in ensuring these bears have a fighting chance.

**Closing Paragraph:**  
Thank you for being a defender of polar bears. Together, we can make a difference. Your support is not just a donation—it’s a commitment to protecting these incredible animals for future generations.

**Sign-off:**  
Sincerely,
