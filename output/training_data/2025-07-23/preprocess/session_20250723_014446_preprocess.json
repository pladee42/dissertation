    "prompt": "## Instruction:\n\nYou are an expert email copywriter. Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.\n\nFinally, ensure the email is concise **(300 - 500 words)** and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. \n\n**IMPORTANT:** Generate exactly ONE complete email. Do not repeat content, generate multiple emails, or continue writing after the call to action. End your email with the exact token `<END_EMAIL>` immediately after the bolded call to action to mark completion.\n\nGive me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive \u2013 reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals \u2013 about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

These moments bring comfort and joy to children facing challenging times while they recover. However, we face hurdles like limited staff availability which means fewer opportunities for these precious interactions. This gap leaves many kids longing for companionship beyond their medical care teams.\n\nAs part of Bright Futures Foundation\u2014a nonprofit dedicated to enriching lives through education and support programs\u2014we have initiated 'Readers Unite,' a program inviting community members to share stories and laughter with young patients undergoing treatment. We believe everyone has something special to offer, including you. Whether seasoned readers or novices eager to make connections, all contributions matter immensely here.\n\nYour participation can light up someone else's world when they need it most. By dedicating just one hour each weekend, you become a beacon of hope amidst uncertainty. It doesn't require professional training but rather empathy, patience, and love \u2014 qualities within reach for anyone willing to step forward into this rewarding experience. Together, let's create memorable encounters where healing goes hand-in-hand with imagination and storytime adventure.\n\nTo sign up today or find out how simple getting involved really is click HERE <LINK>. You might discover hidden talents along the way too! Let's join forces because together there lies unlimited potential waiting to transform little hearts around us.

The sight alone should stir concern deep enough to drive change. At GreenOcean Initiative, founded over two decades ago, we work tirelessly against such environmental crises. But even giants sometimes falter before nature's relentless waves. That's why your involvement could mean everything between victory and defeat.\n\nPlastic waste isn't merely unsightly debris floating aimlessly; it breaks down into microplastics ingested by fishes leading them astray toward extinction paths unknown. Coral reefs suffer suffocation beneath layers upon layers of refuse, robbing countless species of homes and food sources. And yet, despite awareness campaigns echoing across continents, single-use items still populate landfill sites faster than recycle bins overflow.\n\nHere's where YOU come in. As advocates rally behind sustainable alternatives, individuals who choose conscientious consumption choices fuel progress exponentially. Imagine if thousands shared my resolve daily? Picture communities adopting zero-waste lifestyles instead of mindlessly discarding convenience packaged goods. Envision schools teaching future generations about responsible stewardship starting tomorrow thanks to grassroots movements ignited tonight. With collective effort comes monumental impact.\n\nThe challenge may seem daunting, I won't sugarcoat it\u2013but neither was saving polar bear habitats back then nor cleaning air quality indexes once thought irredeemable. What matters most aren't grand gestures made solely by policymakers; small actions accumulate powerfully until suddenly...they don't look insignificant anymore. They represent seeds sown diligently throughout seasons past blooming gloriously present sunrises ahead.

As someone who loves reading and has a passion for helping others, I believe that this opportunity would be an incredible way to give back to my community.\n\nAs a child, I was fortunate enough to have access to books and learning materials that helped me succeed academically and personally.
