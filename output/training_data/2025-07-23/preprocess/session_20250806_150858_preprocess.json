    "prompt": "## Instruction:\n\nYou are an expert email copywriter. Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.\n\nFinally, ensure the email is concise **(300 - 500 words)** and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. \n\n**IMPORTANT:** Generate exactly ONE complete email. Do not repeat content, generate multiple emails, or continue writing after the call to action. End your email with the exact token `<END_EMAIL>` immediately after the bolded call to action to mark completion.\n\nGive me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive – reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals – about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

They even got to visit a college campus and hear from successful alumni.\n* We celebrated National Night Out by hosting a block party with games, food, and fun activities for the whole community. It was a great way to build relationships and strengthen our neighborhood.\n\nAs always, we couldn't do any of this without the support of our dedicated staff, volunteers, and donors.

As we approach the end of another month, we wanted to share with you our latest accomplishments and successes at the Boys & Girls Club. We’re proud to report that our members have continued to thrive and grow throughout the year, and we couldn’t be happier about it.\n\nOur clubhouse has been transformed into a vibrant hub of activity, with programs ranging from sports to art to technology to music. Our tech program alone has seen over 600 students use their laptops and tablets, and we’ve had a 90% retention rate for our tech classes. Our sports program has also seen impressive growth, with 75% of our participants taking part in at least one sporting event.\n\nBut what truly sets us apart is our commitment to helping our members succeed beyond the walls of our clubhouse. We’ve launched several initiatives this year to address the needs of our community, including a summer food drive and a mentorship program aimed at supporting underprivileged youth.\n\nAs we look towards the future, we’re excited to expand our programming and reach even more members. In addition to our existing programs, we’re currently working on developing a new program focused on mental health awareness and resources for our members. This will provide them with the tools they need to cope with the challenges they face outside of our clubhouse.\n\nWe’d like to take this opportunity to thank each and every member who has made an impact on our clubhouse this year. Whether it was through their dedication to their clubs, their contributions to our community, or simply by being a positive influence in their lives, we’re grateful for all that you do.\n\nThank you for being a part of our clubhouse family. We can’t wait to see what the next few months hold for us.\n\nWith best regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n\nExecutive Director, Boys & Girls Club\n\n[Your Email]\n\n[END_EMAIL]\n",

From summer camps that focused on STEM learning to after-school programs that fostered leadership skills, every activity has been tailored to meet the unique needs of each member.\n\nOne of our most significant achievements this month was launching a brand-new initiative called \"Leadership Academy.\" This program aims to empower young people by providing them with the tools they need to become confident, responsible, and compassionate leaders in their communities. We believe that fostering these qualities early on can make all the difference in shaping positive futures for generations to come.\n\nOur team has put together a comprehensive curriculum that includes workshops on communication, conflict resolution, teamwork, and much more. The academy will run for six months, during which participants will receive regular feedback and guidance from experienced mentors.\n\nWe're excited about what lies ahead for this program, but we couldn't do it without your support.

As we reflect upon another year filled with growth, learning, and community building within our beloved Boys & Girls Club, we wanted to share some highlight moments that truly define what makes us unique – because together, there’s nothing we can't achieve.\n\nOur journey began when young minds were eager but lacked direction; now they stand ready to conquer their dreams thanks to programs like STEM Innovators, which have sparked curiosity across countless classrooms nationwide. We witnessed firsthand how empowerment through education leads to real-world success stories — such as Mariah Johnson, who went from being unsure about her future career path to leading robotics workshops inspired by her experience here.\n\nThe heartbeat of every club lies in volunteers just like yourself—dedicated individuals committed to nurturing potential wherever it may be found. This month alone saw over two hundred hours poured into mentorship sessions, art classes, sports events, and much more, all contributing towards shaping confident leaders equipped with skills necessary for tomorrow’s world. From helping kids overcome academic hurdles during remote school days to organizing virtual field trips exploring diverse cultures around globe, each act has woven threads stronger than ever before creating vibrant tapestries representing unity despite distance.\n\nIn recognition of everyone involved directly impacting lives daily while fostering resilience among youth facing adversity head-on–we extend our deepest gratitude toward those making miracles happen behind closed doors day after day...and night after night until dawn breaks again signaling yet another opportunity brimming with promise awaiting discovery under bright sunlight illuminating paths previously untraveled down roads less taken where stars align perfectly guiding steps forward rather than retreating backward fearfully looking upwards wondering if one small misstep could lead them astray forever lost amongst infinite possibilities stretching out infinitely far beyond sightline horizon lines blurring
