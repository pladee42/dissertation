    "prompt": "## Instruction:\n\nYou are an expert email copywriter. Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.\n\nFinally, ensure the email is concise **(300 - 500 words)** and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. \n\n**IMPORTANT:** Generate exactly ONE complete email. Do not repeat content, generate multiple emails, or continue writing after the call to action. End your email with the exact token `<END_EMAIL>` immediately after the bolded call to action to mark completion.\n\nGive me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive – reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals – about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

Picture being followed wherever you go, watched endlessly because someone deemed certain opinions dangerous enough to warrant suppression. Sadly, this grim scenario mirrors current events involving facial recognition software misused to quash peaceful protestors fighting for social reforms. Organizations like Amnesty International ([Sending Organization]) work tirelessly to combat abuses arising from state security apparatuses exploiting cutting-edge biometric systems to stifle legitimate public discourse. But even giants cannot battle alone. You hold power too—the ability to speak truthfully, act responsibly, demand transparency, and insist on accountability among those wielding control over pervasive monitoring mechanisms. Will you join hands with fellow citizens committed to upholding universal human rights? Are you ready to become a bulwark against tyranny disguised as protection? If yes, then seize this momentous opportunity to make waves alongside global allies dedicated to preserving autonomy and liberty. Get involved right away—sign petitions calling for stringent regulations governing private entities deploying tracking algorithms indiscriminately. Participate vigorously in online campaigns raising critical issues surrounding consent, data ownership, and potential harms stemming from mass surveillance tactics. Attend virtual town halls hosted by digital rights groups discussing innovative solutions aimed at restoring balance between safety measures and citizen privacy. Connect directly with policymakers via letter-writing drives emphasizing shared concerns regarding governmental oversight lacking proper checks and balances. Launch grassroots mobilizations encouraging others to question authorities responsible for implementing high-tech spying methods into daily life routines. Foster interpersonal connections fostering trustworthiness amongst peers eager to exchange knowledge concerning emerging trends affecting civic space dynamics negatively impacting society collectively.

This nightmare scenario is becoming all too real in our country thanks to the government's increasing use of facial recognition technology.\n\nThis technology is supposed to be used to keep us safe, but in reality, it's being used to suppress dissent and silence marginalized communities. The government is using it to track protesters, activists, and anyone who dares to speak out against their policies.\n\nBut there's hope! A coalition of civil liberties organizations has come together to expose the truth about this surveillance state and demand that our leaders take action to protect our rights. We need your help to make sure our voices are heard!\n\nWill you join us in calling on Congress to pass legislation banning the use of facial recognition technology for law enforcement purposes? Every signature counts, and together we can create a safer, freer society for everyone.\n\n**Sign the petition today and help stop the government's secret surveillance!**\n",

This disturbing trend threatens our fundamental human rights and undermines democracy itself.\n\nAs you may already know, facial recognition software has been adopted by law enforcement agencies, border control authorities, and even some national security organizations. These systems can capture vast amounts of data about individuals, including their identity, location, behavior, and emotions. While this might seem like a tool for security and safety, the reality is much darker.\n\nThe widespread use of facial recognition technology raises serious privacy concerns. It enables mass surveillance, which violates the right to privacy enshrined in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Moreover, it can be used to target specific groups of people, such as minorities, political dissidents, and religious minorities, without due process or safeguards.\n\nIn addition, there have been numerous reports of wrongful arrests, mistrials, and miscarriages of justice resulting from flawed algorithms and biased training data. This is a grave injustice that cannot be justified under any circumstances.\n\nWe need to act now before it's too late. By joining us, you will become part of a global movement fighting against the misuse of facial recognition technology. Together, we can raise awareness, advocate for legislative reforms, and hold those responsible accountable for their actions.\n\nPlease click the link below to join our petition and show your support for human rights and democratic values.\n\n[WEBSITE LINK]\n\nTogether, let us create a world where everyone can live free from the threat of mass surveillance and arbitrary detention.\n\nThank you for taking action.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]\n",
