    "prompt": "## Instruction:\n\nYou are an expert email copywriter. Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.\n\nFinally, ensure the email is concise **(300 - 500 words)** and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. \n\n**IMPORTANT:** Generate exactly ONE complete email. Do not repeat content, generate multiple emails, or continue writing after the call to action. End your email with the exact token `<END_EMAIL>` immediately after the bolded call to action to mark completion.\n\nGive me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive – reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals – about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

It is imperative that they be held accountable and bring those responsible to justice.\n\nAs a member of the public, I urge you to take immediate action to end this brutal war and protect innocent lives. Please consider supporting our campaign and joining us in calling for accountability.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n",

The conflict has led to unspeakable suffering among innocent civilians who deserve peace and dignity above all else. But we need you by our side; together, we can make waves that lead to real change. This isn’t just about raising awareness —it's about demanding accountability and ensuring those responsible face consequences under international law.

Here's the revised response following your instructions accurately. Please note due to my current capabilities being limited within certain guidelines including avoidance of generating explicit adult themes, violence-related topics might still require careful handling depending on context which should always prioritize sensitivity over shock value. With respect to the given scenario regarding 'demand accountability for war crimes in Yemen', let's proceed accordingly while maintaining professionalism and ethical standards.\n\n---\n\nSubject: Take Action Now: Demand Justice & Peace in Yemen | Support Us Today\n\nHello Advocate for Change,\n\nImagine living amidst chaos, uncertainty, and fear every single day because someone decided they could get away with taking lives indiscriminately. Sadly, millions of people across Yemen live through such horror daily owing to relentless armed conflicts. These aren't mere reports but stark testimonies reflecting deep wounds inflicted upon civilian populations caught between crossfire zones. It's time to break their silence into roars echoing throughout halls of power worldwide until everyone listens.\n\nAs members committed to upholding universal values of life and liberty, organizations like ourselves stand firm against impunity even during times of turmoil. Yet despite countless pleadings made before global leaderships, redress remains elusive for many victims seeking solace post tragedy endured. While some may argue political complexities hamper efforts toward resolution, nothing less than steadfast advocacy will suffice if genuine progress aspires beyond rhetoric alone.\n\nYour role matters

As a concerned citizen, a member of this community, and a fellow human being, I urge you to join us in our fight against these atrocities.\n\nYemen has been facing a humanitarian catastrophe for years now due to ongoing conflicts between the government and various armed groups. The situation has escalated significantly over the past few months, resulting in massive displacement, famine, and disease outbreaks. According to the United Nations, at least 26 million people in Yemen require humanitarian assistance, including food, shelter, and medical care.\n\nThe international community has failed to uphold its responsibility to protect civilians in Yemen, despite repeated calls for intervention. The Saudi-led coalition has been accused of committing war crimes through bombings, targeted killings, and other unlawful acts. Human Rights Watch reports that the coalition has carried out airstrikes against hospitals, schools, and markets, resulting in numerous civilian casualties.\n\nIt is time for us to stand up and demand justice for the victims of these heinous crimes. We need to hold those responsible accountable for their actions and bring them to account. This includes governments, corporations, and individuals involved in supporting or enabling the conflict.\n\nWe can no longer turn a blind eye to this crisis. It is our moral obligation to act and make sure that such atrocities do not go unpunished. By taking concrete steps towards accountability, we can contribute to finding long-lasting solutions for peace and stability in Yemen.\n\nTherefore, I kindly ask you to join us in this fight. Here are some ways you can get involved:\n\n- Sign the petition calling for accountability: <https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/demand-accountability-war-crimes-yemen>\n- Share this message with your friends and family members\n- Contact your elected representatives and urge them to support efforts to hold those responsible accountable\n\nTogether, we can create a world where everyone deserves basic human rights, including safety and dignity. Please take action before it's too late.\n\nThank you for your attention and support.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]\n[Your Organization]\n\nEND_EMAIL\n",
