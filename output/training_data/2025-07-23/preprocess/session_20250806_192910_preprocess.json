    "prompt": "## Instruction:\n\nYou are an expert email copywriter. Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.\n\nFinally, ensure the email is concise **(300 - 500 words)** and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. \n\n**IMPORTANT:** Generate exactly ONE complete email. Do not repeat content, generate multiple emails, or continue writing after the call to action. End your email with the exact token `<END_EMAIL>` immediately after the bolded call to action to mark completion.\n\nGive me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive – reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals – about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

At Public Media Initiative, we recognize that trustworthy information forms the bedrock of informed citizenship. But when falsehoods spread like wildfire across social media platforms, they erode this foundation faster than ever before.\n\nThe challenge lies within complex algorithms designed by tech giants which prioritize sensationalism over accuracy. As these stories go viral, their truthfulness becomes less important compared to views and clicks. This creates fertile ground where fake news thrives unchecked. It affects elections, public health decisions, and even personal relationships — all because someone didn't fact-check thoroughly enough. The consequences? A society increasingly divided along lines drawn out of thin air.\n\nThat's why at PMI, dedicated teams work tirelessly around the clock identifying potential hoaxes using advanced analytics tools while partnering closely with experts who can verify facts quickly but accurately. We also educate communities through interactive webinars, digital literacy programs tailored specifically towards different age groups including seniors prone to scams targeting them directly via phone calls masquerading as legitimate entities such as banks etc.. By equipping people with critical thinking skills alongside reliable resources about how journalistic integrity works today versus yesterday provides everyone involved access needed knowledge necessary discernment between real vs fabricated narratives presented daily both offline & online mediums alike . Furthermore ,we have developed innovative partnerships involving local schools teachers whom teach students research methods helping detect fallacies early thus preventing further dissemination once

We wanted to reach out to let you know about our exciting new project, which we believe will have a significant impact on your community. Our mission is to combat misinformation and promote fact-based news and information in your area.\n\nAs you may know, misinformation has become increasingly prevalent in recent years, particularly during times of political uncertainty and social unrest. This has led to a rise in conspiracy theories, false claims, and disinformation that can have serious consequences.\n\nPublic media plays a vital role in combating these issues by providing accurate and trustworthy news and information to the public. By partnering with us, you will be able to access a range of resources and programs designed to address the challenges facing your community.\n\nOur first project is focused on providing educational materials and resources to schools, including curriculum development, teacher training, and digital literacy workshops. This initiative is crucial because many students lack access to reliable information, and they are at risk of being misled by misinformation.\n\nIn addition, we plan to launch a community-focused program that provides regular updates and analysis on local events, such as elections, protests, and natural disasters. This will help citizens make informed decisions and stay informed about the issues affecting their communities.\n\nWe understand that your time is valuable, so we aim to provide clear, concise, and accurate information that is easy to digest. Our team is comprised of experienced journalists and fact-checkers who are dedicated to providing the highest quality reporting.\n\nWe invite you to join us in this important effort to combat misinformation and promote fact-based news and information in your community. If you would like to learn more about our project, please visit our website or contact us directly.\n\nThank you for your consideration. We look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n\n[Your Title]\n\n[Your Organization]\n",
