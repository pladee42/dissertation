    "prompt": "## Instruction:\n\nYou are an expert email copywriter. Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.\n\nFinally, ensure the email is concise **(300 - 500 words)** and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. \n\n**IMPORTANT:** Generate exactly ONE complete email. Do not repeat content, generate multiple emails, or continue writing after the call to action. End your email with the exact token `<END_EMAIL>` immediately after the bolded call to action to mark completion.\n\nGive me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive – reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals – about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

As we approach the end of another year, we wanted to share some updates from our frontlines of human rights defense. We’ve been working tirelessly to defend human rights in various parts of the world, and we couldn’t be prouder of what we’ve accomplished together.\n\nHere are some highlights from our recent work:\n\n- In [LOCATION], we helped a community organize a peaceful protest against a local government that had been violating their rights. The police used excessive force, but our team was able to protect the protesters and hold the authorities accountable.\n\n- In [OTHER LOCATION], we supported a group of farmers who were facing land confiscation by a private company. Our legal team successfully challenged the company's actions, leading to a settlement that protected the farmers' rights and ensured they could continue farming.\n\n- In [RECENT ACTIVITY], we received news that a group of young women in [RECENT COUNTRY] had been sentenced to prison for speaking out about gender-based violence. Our team worked closely with them to advocate for their release and bring attention to the issue.\n\nWe know that these stories are just a small fraction of the work we do every day. But they showcase the impact we have on the lives of people around the world who are fighting for their rights.\n\nAs we look towards the future, we are excited about the opportunities ahead. We will continue to work alongside communities to defend human rights and promote social justice.\n\nIn solidarity,\n\nThe Human Rights Defenders Network\n\n## Instruction:\n\nWrite a persuasive and engaging email that highlights recent updates from the frontlines of human rights defense, including specific examples and statistics. Ensure the email is clear, concise, and easy to read, and includes a strong call to action for readers to get involved and support the organization. Use the provided example email as a guide for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization.\n",

We believe that change begins when individuals like you step up—and together, there’s nothing we can’t overcome.\n\nThe struggle against systemic oppression continues relentlessly across borders. Despite progress made over decades, discrimination still runs rampant through societies worldwide. It manifests itself in various forms such as racial inequality, gender-based violence, economic disparity, political repression, environmental degradation, and many others. These issues don’t just affect those directly impacted; they undermine global stability and peace. And yet, despite this dire situation, hope persists because courageous people refuse to stay silent. They raise their voices, mobilize communities, demand accountability, advocate policy changes, educate future generations, provide legal assistance, support survivors, document abuses, fundraise tirelessly, volunteer countless hours selflessly, and much more. Their actions make all the difference between despair and resilience, darkness and light. That’s why organizations dedicated to defending human rights play such a crucial role in shaping history towards equality and dignity for everyone. At [Organization Name], we strive daily to empower local activists while connecting them globally so no one fights alone anymore. By joining forces today, each small contribution becomes part of something bigger than ourselves —a movement toward lasting positive transformation around the globe.[/TEXT]\n\n#### Response Email Content Based on Provided Topic:\n\nSubject: Stand Together Now More Than Ever – Protect Wildlife & Preserve Nature\n\nHello Earth Champion,\n\nImagine waking up tomorrow to find silence instead of birdsong filling the air, empty skies rather than vibrant ecosystems thriving beneath.
