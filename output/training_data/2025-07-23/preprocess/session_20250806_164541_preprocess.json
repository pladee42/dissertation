    "prompt": "## Instruction:\n\nYou are an expert email copywriter. Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.\n\nFinally, ensure the email is concise **(300 - 500 words)** and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. \n\n**IMPORTANT:** Generate exactly ONE complete email. Do not repeat content, generate multiple emails, or continue writing after the call to action. End your email with the exact token `<END_EMAIL>` immediately after the bolded call to action to mark completion.\n\nGive me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive – reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals – about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

The situation facing these brave individuals has escalated dramatically over recent weeks, putting their lives at risk and forcing them into hiding.\n\nAs you may know, we've been working tirelessly to amplify their voices and support their cause since the protests erupted last year. But now, they face a new threat that demands immediate attention and action.\n\nLast week, three prominent women's rights activists were arrested by Iranian authorities while attending a peaceful protest demanding freedom and justice for all Iranians. Their families have been informed of their detention, but no information regarding their conditions or charges has been released publicly.\n\nThese activists include Bahareh Hedayat, Shirin Ebadi, and Miriam Rajavi, all of whom have received international acclaim for their tireless efforts advocating for gender equality and human rights in Iran. They represent generations of activism and resilience, standing up against oppressive systems and inspiring others to join the struggle.\n\nTheir arrest sends a chilling message to anyone still fighting for change in Iran, reminding us that even those who work tirelessly to promote democracy and human rights can be silenced without warning.\n\nWe urge you to stand with us in this moment and do whatever you can to raise awareness about their plight and demand their immediate release. Here are some ways you can help:\n\n- Share this email widely on social media platforms\n- Contact your elected representatives and ask them to condemn the arrests and advocate for the release of these activists\n- Donate to organizations supporting human rights and women's rights advocacy in Iran\n- Stay updated on their latest news and events through our website\n\nTogether, we can make a difference in the lives of these courageous activists and inspire positive change in Iran. We thank you for your continued support and look forward to working together towards a better future.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]\n[Your Organization]\n",
