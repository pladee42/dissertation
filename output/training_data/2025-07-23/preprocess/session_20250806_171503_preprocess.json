    "prompt": "## Instruction:\n\nYou are an expert email copywriter. Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.\n\nFinally, ensure the email is concise **(300 - 500 words)** and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. \n\n**IMPORTANT:** Generate exactly ONE complete email. Do not repeat content, generate multiple emails, or continue writing after the call to action. End your email with the exact token `<END_EMAIL>` immediately after the bolded call to action to mark completion.\n\nGive me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive – reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals – about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

Since then, we have worked tirelessly to advocate for the most vulnerable populations, including refugees, internally displaced persons, and victims of gross violations of human rights.\n\nOver the years, we have seen tremendous success in our efforts. Today, we can proudly say that we have successfully advocated for the adoption of several key conventions and treaties, such as the Convention against Torture, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture.\n\nBut these victories wouldn't be possible without your support. As we celebrate this milestone, I urge you to join us in continuing our work by making a donation today. Every dollar counts and will go directly towards amplifying the voices of those who need it most.\n\nTogether, we can make a lasting impact on the world by standing up for human rights.\n\nThank you for being part of our journey, and here's to another 20 years of working together to create a better world for all.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]\n\n[Your Organization]\n\n[Your Email Address]\n\n[Phone Number]\n\n-END_EMAIL\n",

As you know, The Hague has been a beacon of hope for justice for over two decades now. Our mission has always been to use the power of law to bring about positive change in the world. And we have done just that!\n\nToday, we are proud to say that we have made significant progress in advancing human rights and fighting for justice around the globe. From the International Criminal Court to the United Nations, we have worked tirelessly to protect vulnerable communities and hold those who commit crimes against humanity accountable.\n\nBut it wasn't easy. In fact, it was often a difficult and dangerous journey. We faced countless obstacles along the way, including threats, harassment, and even physical violence. But through it all, we never gave up. We knew that our work was important, and that justice needed to be served.\n\nIn this special anniversary edition, we want to take a look back at some of our most memorable moments. We’ve compiled a selection of photos and videos that showcase our work over the years. We’re also featuring some of our most inspiring stories and testimonies from survivors and witnesses.\n\nWe'd like to invite you to join us in this journey. Together, we can make a difference.\n\nPlease let us know if there's anything we can do to support you in your efforts.
