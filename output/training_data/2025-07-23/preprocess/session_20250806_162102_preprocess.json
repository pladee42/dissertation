    "prompt": "## Instruction:\n\nYou are an expert email copywriter. Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.\n\nFinally, ensure the email is concise **(300 - 500 words)** and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. \n\n**IMPORTANT:** Generate exactly ONE complete email. Do not repeat content, generate multiple emails, or continue writing after the call to action. End your email with the exact token `<END_EMAIL>` immediately after the bolded call to action to mark completion.\n\nGive me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive – reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals – about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

From sweatshop labor to environmental devastation, these companies prioritize profits over people and the planet.\n\nThe truth is, many of these corporations have been exploiting vulnerable communities for far too long. They've manipulated laws, silenced whistleblowers, and even used violence to maintain their grip on power.\n\nBut there's hope. As consumers, investors, and citizens, we hold the power to demand change. We can use our collective voices to pressure corporations into accountability.\n\nThat's why I'm reaching out today to invite you to join us in taking a stand against corporate complicity. Our organization has been working tirelessly to expose these injustices and push for real reform.\n\nBy joining our movement, you'll be part of a growing coalition that's refusing to accept business-as-usual. Together, we'll shine a light on those who are perpetuating harm and create a better future for all.\n\nHere are three ways you can get involved:\n\n1.  Share this message with friends and family to spread awareness\n2.  Sign our petition calling on corporations to end their complicity in human rights abuses\n3.  Donate to support our ongoing work exposing corporate wrongdoings\n\n**Take action now and join the movement to end corporate complicity in human rights abuses!**\n",

This isn’t just a scene from dystopian fiction; this has been reality for countless individuals worldwide due to corporate complicity in grave human rights abuses. As members of [Organization Name], we witness these horrors daily but refuse to stand idle while they persist. It takes courageous souls like yours to shine light into dark corners where power corrupts innocence. Will you join us?\n\nThe Problem & The Obstacle Causing It:\nHuman rights violations occur when companies turn blind eyes towards exploitation within their supply chains, whether through forced labor, child workforce recruitment, unsafe working conditions, environmental destruction, discrimination, gender-based violence, arbitrary arrests/detentions, torture, extrajudicial killings, rape, sexual slavery, trafficking, unlawful surveillance, intimidation, harassment, censorship, propaganda dissemination, mass displacements, cultural genocide, denial of basic freedoms such as education, healthcare accessibility, freedom of expression, assembly, association, religion, property ownership, privacy protection, fair trial guarantees, participation in public affairs, social security benefits, equal opportunities irrespective of race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sex, age, language, religious belief, political opinion, economic status, physical ability, mental capacity, HIV positive status, LGBTQIA+ identity, etc.—all so business can flourish unfettered by moral accountability. We must confront our collective failure here head-on if there ever was one. But how do we begin tackling something seemingly insurmountable? Enter organizations committed wholeheartedly toward justice reform initiatives aimed specifically at eradicating systemic oppression perpetuated via global capitalism — including those who profit directly off others’ suffering yet remain silent about it all too often out of self-interest alone…and ultimately creating lasting change together instead merely reactively responding temporarily

We are writing to bring attention to a pressing issue that affects all of us: corporate complicity in human rights abuses. As you know, companies around the world have been implicated in some of the most egregious human rights violations of our time. These include massacres, torture, and forced labor, among others.\n\nIn response to these atrocities, many organizations have called for corporate accountability. However, despite years of activism, progress has been slow. This is because corporations have been able to avoid responsibility by shifting blame onto their suppliers, subcontractors, and other third parties. This practice is known as \"corporate complicity.\"\n\nThe good news is that there are solutions. One such solution is the [PROPOSED PROJECT/EVENT/CONTENT]. It will bring together leading experts, advocates, and activists to discuss how we can work together to end corporate complicity in human rights abuses.\n\nAs you may be aware, this project is being organized by [SENDING ORGANIZATION NAME], a non-profit dedicated to promoting human rights and social justice. They have already secured funding from [FUNDER NAME], who are committed to supporting this important initiative.\n\nTo join this movement and support the project, please visit [LINK TO PROJECT WEBSITE]. You can also sign up for updates by emailing [EMAIL ADDRESS].\n\nThank you for your continued efforts in standing up for human rights. Together, we can make a difference.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n\n### Instruction:\n\nMake sure to include all relevant information about the event/announcement/content, including the date, location, and any required registration or participation details.\n",
