    "prompt": "## Instruction:\n\nYou are an expert email copywriter. Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.\n\nFinally, ensure the email is concise **(300 - 500 words)** and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. \n\n**IMPORTANT:** Generate exactly ONE complete email. Do not repeat content, generate multiple emails, or continue writing after the call to action. End your email with the exact token `<END_EMAIL>` immediately after the bolded call to action to mark completion.\n\nGive me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive \u2013 reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals \u2013 about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

It breaks my heart knowing these young minds have so much promise yet face such barriers daily just because they can't afford simple necessities.

We strive tirelessly to bridge this gap but need community support to make lasting change possible. Here's how you can join us:\n\n- Donate directly via our website ($XX per item). Every dollar goes straight towards purchasing high-quality materials for underprivileged students. You could literally turn someone's dream into a tangible possibility today!\n- Volunteer during distribution events held monthly throughout various communities within our city limits. Not only will you witness firsthand the impactful difference made when kids receive what was previously out of reach, but also experience unparalleled joy seeing those bright eyes light up upon

As someone who cares deeply about education and community development, I am writing to ask for your assistance in supporting our local initiative that aims to distribute school supplies to underprivileged children in our area.\n\nOver the past year, many families have faced unprecedented challenges due to the pandemic. The sudden shift to remote learning has made it difficult for students to access basic resources such as textbooks, notebooks, pencils, and pens. This issue disproportionately affects low-income families, who may struggle to afford these essentials at home.\n\nThat's why we're launching a fundraising campaign to collect donations of school supplies for children in need. We've set up a simple online form where anyone can contribute what they can spare, whether it's a few dollars or a full box of supplies.\n\nYour contribution will go directly towards purchasing much-needed items for children who might otherwise miss out on the opportunity to succeed in school. By partnering with us, you'll be helping to create a brighter future for these young people and their communities.\n\nAs a valued member of our community, I hope you'll consider making a difference by donating to this important cause. Every little bit counts, and together, we can make a significant impact.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my message. If you have any questions or would like to get involved further, please don't hesitate to reach out. Together, let's work towards creating a better world for all.\n\nWarm regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n[Your Title/Position]\n[Your Organization]\n\n---\n\nToken:\n",
