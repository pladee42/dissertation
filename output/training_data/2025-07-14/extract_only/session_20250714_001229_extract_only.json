    "prompt": "## Instruction:\n\nYou are an expert email copywriter. Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.\n\nFinally, ensure the email is concise (under 500 words) and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. Give me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive – reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals – about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

As these whales navigate through narrow shipping lanes, their lives hang in the balance.\n\nAt Sea Guardians, we've seen firsthand the devastating effects of ship strikes. These incidents are not just accidents; they are preventable tragedies that we can stop together.\n\nYour support can make a real difference. By signing our petition, you are standing up for the right whales, urging authorities and stakeholders to implement safer shipping practices. Your voice is powerful, and together, we can alter the course for these magnificent creatures.\n\nThe petition is simple: ask for the change we all wish to see.

Recent studies show that 22% of patients undergoing dialysis annually are affected by these infections, often due to the very equipment designed to save their lives.\n\nBloodstream infections are a severe complication for patients with kidney failure, leading to longer hospital stays, increased medical costs, and, tragically, higher mortality rates. The culprit is often poor hygiene and outdated dialysis technology.\n\nAt NephroCare Innovations, we're dedicated to changing the narrative. Our cutting-edge dialysis machines are equipped with the latest antimicrobial technology, ensuring that each session is as safe as it is life-saving. Dr. Sarah Mendez, a renowned nephrologist, states, \"The future of dialysis care lies in technological innovation that prioritizes patient safety above all.\"\n\nWe are not only introducing safer technology; we're also setting a new standard for preventive care. As you read this, know that we're committed to making BSIs a thing of the past.\n\nOur color-coded user interface uses a soothing palette to guide patients and healthcare professionals through the care process, reducing stress and potential for error. \"It's like having a guardian angel watching over you,\" says one patient, highlighting the comfort our technology provides.\n\nWhile the subject line of this email might initially seem to focus on a different topic, the real story here is one of hope and innovation in the fight against BSIs.\n\nJoin us for an exclusive webinar to learn more about how NephroCare Innovations is transforming dialysis care. Let's work together to protect our patients and improve their quality of life.\n\nRegister now and be a part of the solution.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nEmily Thompson\nDirector of Innovation, NephroCare Innovations\n\n---\n\n\n## Instruction:\n\nYou are an email copywriter tasked with creating a powerful and persuasive email.
