    "prompt": "## Instruction:\n\nYou are an expert email copywriter. Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.\n\nFinally, ensure the email is concise (under 500 words) and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. Give me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive – reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals – about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

Present a case study of a specific affected species.\n\n5.   Offer a clear call to action for readers to join a particular campaign.\n\n6.

Conclude with an inspirational quote about the ocean.\n\n9.   Maintain a tone of urgency without inciting panic.\n\n10.   The entire email must be between 600-700 words.\n\n11.   The email must not include any form of advertising, such as product placement or sponsored content.\n\n12.   It must feature a visually appealing subject line.\n\n\n## Response:\n\nSubject: The Silent Crisis Beneath: Our Oceans' Vital Battle Against Acidity\n\nDear Ocean Advocates,\n\nAs the sun casts its golden rays upon the vast blue expanse, our oceans face an invisible yet formidable adversary – rising acidity. This invisible foe threatens not just the marine life we take for granted but the very fabric of our ecosystem.\n\nRecent data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reveals that ocean acidity levels have risen by 30% since the industrial revolution, a change occurring over just a few centuries. This dramatic shift in our ocean's chemistry disrupts the delicate balance of marine life, impacting everything from the smallest plankton to the largest whale.\n\nDr. Sylvia Earle, a renowned marine biologist and ocean explorer, warns, \"We've always been connected to the ocean. Now we're really seeing the consequences of our actions. It's time to change course.\"\n\nThe story of the Pacific oyster, a keystone species, illustrates this point vividly. Once abundant, their numbers have dwindled as their calcified shells dissolve in the more acidic waters. A local fisherman, John, recounts his struggle with the changing tides: \"My oyster beds used to be a reliable source of income. Now, I watch helplessly as they vanish before my eyes.\"\n\nJohn's plight is not unique. Across our coastlines, fishermen and women are witnessing the impacts of ocean acidification first-hand. But there is hope. The Ocean Acidity Resilience Campaign invites you to join us in taking action to protect our marine life and the communities that rely on them.\n\nYour involvement can spark a wave of change. By participating in our 'Sea the Change' initiative, you'll help us:\n\n- Advocate for policies that reduce carbon emissions and combat",
