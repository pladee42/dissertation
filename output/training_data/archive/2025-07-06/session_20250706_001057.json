    "prompt": "## Instruction:\n\nYou are an expert email copywriter. Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.\n\nFinally, ensure the email is concise (under 500 words) and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. Give me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive – reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals – about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

However, with overfishing, pollution, and climate change, these vital ecosystems are under threat - and fast.\n\nThe reefs are bleaching at an alarming rate, meaning they are losing their vibrant colors and, with them, their vitality. This not only impacts the marine life that depends on them but also the thousands of people who rely on these reefs for their source of food, income, and coastal protection.\n\nBut there is hope. The University of Sheffield has embarked on a pioneering coral reef conservation project, aiming to restore and protect these essential habitats through innovative research and collaborations with local communities and governments.\n\nBy supporting our Coral Reef Conservation Project, you will be joining a global network of individuals and organizations dedicated to preserving our planet's natural beauty and biodiversity.\n\nYour contribution can help us fund research, implement conservation strategies, and spread awareness about the importance of coral reefs. With your help, we can make a real difference in ensuring that these precious ecosystems continue to thrive for generations to come.\n\nTogether, we can protect the future of our coral reefs and the life they support. Please join us in this vital mission by donating to or volunteering for our Coral Reef Conservation Project today.\n\nThank you for your unwavering support and commitment to a better, more sustainable world.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]\n[Your Title]\nUniversity of Sheffield\n\n[CORAL_REEF_CONSERVATION_CALL_TO_ACTION_BOLD]\n\n## Instruction:\n\nYou are an expert email copywriter.

This isn't just a dream; it's a reality for many of our readers who have embraced the Green Thumb Initiative led by Chelsea Thorn.\n\nChelsea Thorn is an acclaimed gardener and environmentalist who believes that \"Every garden is a haven for nature.\" Her mission is to inspire people to create wildlife-friendly gardens, which not only support local ecosystems but also provide a sanctuary for pollinators, birds, and other wildlife.\n\nStatistics show that urban areas have lost over 97% of their natural habitats in the past 50 years. This loss has led to a decline in biodiversity, threatening the delicate balance of our planet's ecosystems. The Green Thumb Initiative aims to reverse this trend by encouraging individuals to transform their gardens into wildlife havens.\n\n\"By planting native flowers, shrubs, and trees, we can create a safe haven for pollinators, providing them with a continuous source of food and shelter,\" says Dr. Alison Green, a renowned ecologist and advocate for sustainable living.\n\nYour contribution to the Green Thumb Initiative can make a tangible impact on preserving our planet's precious biodiversity. Here's how:\n\n- Planting native plants: Native plants are adapted to local conditions and attract pollinators, ensuring their survival.\n- Providing water sources: A small birdbath or shallow dish filled with water will attract a variety of birds and insects.\n- Avoiding pesticides: Chemicals harm pollinators and other wildlife, disrupting the delicate balance of nature.\n\nWe understand that some may have concerns about the effort and cost involved in creating a wildlife-friendly garden. However, the Green Thumb Initiative provides valuable resources, such as planting guides and DIY tutorials, to help you get started. Additionally, the benefits of creating a",
