    "prompt": "## Instruction:\n\nYou are an expert email copywriter. Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.\n\nFinally, ensure the email is concise (under 500 words) and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. Give me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive – reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals – about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

Your writing must achieve the following:\n\n1. Begin with a powerful, emotionally-charged anecdote that illustrates the issue at hand.\n2. Clearly define the problem and its wider impact, using compelling statistics and real-world consequences.\n3. Present the organization (HRC Colorado) as the sole mediator capable of effecting change, detailing its unique approach and track record.\n4. Describe the role of the individual in this cause and how their contribution is vital, using a persuasive and motivational tone.\n5.

Ensure that the email is empathetic, adheres to a professional tone, and is written in a way that engages and informs without overwhelming the reader.\n7. The email must not exceed 600 words.\n8. The call to action must be bolded and placed at the end of the email without any additional text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **Supporting Victims of Human Trafficking:**\n\n## Example:\n\n[EXAMPLE_EMAIL]\n\nEmail:\n\nSubject: Help End the Shadow War on Human Dignity\n\nDear Change-Makers,\n\nAn unspoken nightmare unfolds silently in the shadows of society. I recently encountered a young girl named Maria, whose story is heart-wrenching yet all too common. At 15, she was trafficked and forced into labor, a stark reminder of the plight faced by countless victims around the globe.\n\nMaria's journey from despair to hope is a testament to the power of resilience and the critical role of advocates like us. Yet, her story is far from an isolated incident. According to the International Labour Organization, an estimated 25 million people are victims of human trafficking worldwide.\n\nAt HRC Colorado, we take a stand against this hidden crisis, offering refuge, rehabilitation, and resources to those like Maria who have suffered. Our approach combines policy advocacy, community outreach, and survivor support services, creating a robust network against trafficking.\n\nYour involvement can mean the world to someone like Maria. By volunteering, donating, or simply spreading awareness, you become a beacon of hope, a defender of human rights, and a vital link in a chain that safeguards the most vulnerable.\n\nTake action today:\n\n- Volunteer Training: Join us on [Date] to learn how to identify and support trafficking survivors.\n- Donation Drive: Your contributions fund critical services that uplift victims back to safety.\n- Awareness Campaign: Help us amplify the voices of those who have been silenced.\n\nThe clock is ticking for those in",
