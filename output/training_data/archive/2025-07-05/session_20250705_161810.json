    "prompt": "## Instruction:\n\nYou are an expert email copywriter. Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.\n\nFinally, ensure the email is concise (under 500 words) and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. Give me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive – reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals – about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

With electronic devices becoming ubiquitous, the problem of e-waste has grown exponentially. Statistics show that globally, we generate around 50 million tonnes of e-waste annually, with only 20% being formally recycled.\n\n\n\"By uniting Tech Innovate's technological expertise with EcoSolutions' environmental stewardship, we are setting a new standard for responsible innovation,\" said Dr. Susan Clarke, CEO of Tech Innovate. \"Our mission at GreenTech Innovations is not only to innovate but also to inspire a global shift towards eco-friendly technology.\"\n\n\nMr. Rajiv Singh, CEO of EcoSolutions, added, \"This joint venture epitomizes our commitment to a greener future. By tackling e-waste head-on, we are paving the way for sustainable growth and a cleaner planet.\"\n\n\nGreenTech Innovations will launch several initiatives, including a recycling program that partners with consumers for responsible disposal and a new line of products designed with end-of-life recycling in mind. The venture also plans to collaborate with governments and NGOs to promote e-waste awareness and impactful policy changes.\n\n\n\"Through GreenTech Innovations, we aim to empower communities to take part in the e-waste revolution,\" stated Dr. Clarke. \"Our goal is to create a world where technology and environmental ethics go hand in hand.\"\n\n\nThe joint venture has already attracted attention from industry leaders and environmental groups, who see GreenTech Innovations as a beacon of hope in the fight against e-waste. The collaboration between Tech Innovate and EcoSolutions is a testament to the power of partnership in creating a sustainable future.\n\n\nFor more information on GreenTech Innovations and the joint venture, please contact:\n\n\nJane Doe\n\nDirector of Public Relations\n\nGreenTech Innovations\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nPhone: (123) 456-7890\n\n\n## Solution 2:\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nTech Innovate and EcoSolutions Unveil Revolutionary GreenTech Innovations\n\nCity, State – [Date] – In an unprecedented move towards environmental responsibility, Tech Innovate and EcoSolutions have launched GreenTech Innovations, a joint venture tackling the colossal challenge of electronic waste (e-waste).\n\nGreenTech Innovations is embarking on a mission to revolutionize the recycling and sustainability landscape of the tech industry.
