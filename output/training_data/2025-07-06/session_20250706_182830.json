    "prompt": "## Instruction:\n\nYou are an expert email copywriter. Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.\n\nFinally, ensure the email is concise (under 500 words) and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. Give me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive – reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals – about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

I am writing to you today because I need your help to protect human rights in Belarus.\n\nAs you may know, the country is facing a crisis with the recent release of a political prisoner, who is now at risk of being sent back to prison.

        "content": "Subject: Your Voice Can Change Lives - Support the Belarusian Prisoner Release\n\nDear [Recipient Name],\n\nI hope this message finds you well. Today, I am reaching out to you with a matter of great urgency and hope—a story of resilience and the power of solidarity.\n\nA beacon of light shines through dark times as the international community rallies around a friend in need: the release of a long-term imprisoned believer in Belarus. This individual has been deprived of their freedom and basic human rights for years, yet their spirit remains unbroken.\n\nHowever, our quest for justice is far from over. The Belarusian government has demonstrated a disregard for fair trials and due process, imprisoning this person on dubious grounds. As an organization advocating for human rights and justice, we firmly believe that everyone deserves a fair trial and equal treatment under the law.\n\nWe humbly request your support in shining a spotlight on this case. By raising awareness and sharing the story of this brave man, you can help bring about change. Your voice can send a powerful message to the Belarusian government and the international community: that no one should be denied their rights and freedoms.\n\nTogether, we can make a difference. Every action counts, no matter how small. By joining our cause, you become part of a global movement for justice and human dignity.

Today, I am reaching out to you with a matter of great urgency and hope—a story of resilience and the power of solidarity.\n\nA beacon of light shines through dark times as the international community rallies around a friend in need: the release of a long-term imprisoned believer in Belarus.

Now picture those books slowly disappearing, their pages fading into oblivion. This is not a tale of fiction; it's the stark reality we're facing as marine biodiversity plummets at an alarming rate.\n\nRecent studies reveal a 40% decline in coral reefs globally within the last three decades—oceans are bleaching, starving, and losing their vibrant life. Our marine sanctuaries, akin to the world's most significant libraries, are at risk of being rendered barren.\n\nAs stewards of the earth's aquatic archives, [Organization Name] is at the forefront, championing conservation efforts. Our research indicates that targeted conservation zones can boost marine population recovery by up to 50%. We're leading the charge to turn the tide on this ecological crisis.\n\nYou, as",
