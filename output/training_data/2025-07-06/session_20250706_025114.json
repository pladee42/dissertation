Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive – reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals – about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

This is not just a conservation problem, but a global threat that affects millions of people and the environment.\n\nAs you may know, polar bears are the largest land predators on Earth, with a population of around 25,000 in the wild. Unfortunately, their populations have been declining rapidly due to climate change and habitat destruction. In the past decade alone, polar bear cub populations have declined by 70%, threatening the survival of this iconic species.\n\nUnfortunately, the government's response has been inadequate. The latest plan to protect polar bear cubs only proposes limited protections, and the reintroduction of hunting is still being considered. We believe that the focus should be on protecting the cubs, which requires a significant investment in research, education, and conservation efforts.\n\nWe need your help to support the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, a comprehensive and bold plan to protect the welfare of polar bear cubs across the 17 polar bear habitats in the United States. This act would create a national policy to protect the cubs, establish a science-based and collaborative approach to research and conservation, establish a network of wildlife experts, establish guidelines for education and public outreach, and establish a fund to support research and conservation efforts.\n\nWith your support, we can ensure that the welfare of polar bear cubs is protected and that the iconic species is saved from extinction. The Polar Bear Cub Survival Act is a critical step in achieving this goal, and we urge you to join us in supporting this act.\n\nPlease visit our website [here](https://www.polarbearalliance.org/) to learn more about the act and to take action.\n\n[Insert your name and organization here]\n\nWe appreciate your support and look forward to working together to protect polar bear cubs.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]\n[Your Title]\n[Your Organization Name]\n[Your Email]\n[Your Phone Number]\n\n---\n\n[Insert bolded call to action on its own line]\n\n[Insert a brief summary of what the call to action entails, followed by a call to action to take action.

These brave bears are facing a dire situation, with the loss of their mother and the abandonment of their cubs.\n\nWe understand that your focus is on the conservation of other animals, but a world without polar bears would be a world without beauty, wonder, and awe.\n\nAs an organization dedicated to protecting these animals, we have implemented several successful projects that aim to help these cubs survive.\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act is currently in the House and Senate, and we are asking you to help pass it. We believe that this legislation is essential to protect these animals, as many species are facing extinction due to climate change.\n\nTo support this cause, we have created a petition that you can sign here: [Petition URL].\n\nYour support would mean a lot to us, and we are eager to hear from you.
