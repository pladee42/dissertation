    "prompt": "## Instruction:\n\nYou are an expert email copywriter. Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.\n\nFinally, ensure the email is concise (under 500 words) and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. Give me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive – reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals – about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

        "content": "Dear [Recipient],\n\nWe are thrilled to share the latest findings from the Global Gender Gap Report 2021, which shows that women around the world are making significant strides in their economic and political success.\n\nAccording to the report, women worldwide earned 86.9% of the total global income in 2020, up from 54.9% in 1995. Women in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America saw the highest increases in their earnings, with women in Africa earning 71.4% of global income in 2020, compared to just 33.4% in 1995.\n\nThis progress is encouraging, but we know there is still a long way to go. In fact, women still earn less than men globally across all economic sectors, including in the services sector. The gender gap is particularly acute in countries with high employment rates, such as Brazil, Mexico, and India.\n\nIn light of these findings, we'd like to take a closer look at the situation in [Sending Organization’s Country or Region].\n\n[INSERT OUR COMPANY NAME] is committed to promoting gender equality and women's rights globally. We believe that investing in women has the potential to drive economic growth and improve social equity.\n\nWe’re proud to have played a significant role in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which aim to end poverty, fight inequality, and protect the planet by 2030.

I am impressed by the progress achieved by women around the world, and I am grateful for organizations like [Sending Organization] that are committed to promoting gender equality and women's rights.\n\nI am also concerned about the gender gap in the services sector. It is concerning that women still earn less than men in these sectors globally. We should work together to address this issue and ensure that women are not left behind in the digital economy.\n\nI would like to learn more about [Sending Organization]'s initiatives and collaborations to promote gender equality and women's rights. Could you please provide me with more information about these efforts?\n\nThank you for considering my request.

Gender equality is crucial for a better world, but the truth is, we're still far from achieving it.\n\nAccording to a recent report, 1 in 3 women worldwide will experience physical or sexual violence at some point in their lives. This is unacceptable, and as an organization dedicated to empowering women and girls, we're committed to doing everything in our power to change this.\n\nThat's why we're launching a new campaign, \"Equality for All,\" aimed at amplifying the voices of women who have been silenced and marginalized. We'll be sharing powerful stories, hosting events, and advocating for policies that support gender equality.\n\n**Join us in this fight for equality.

These statistics are a stark reminder of how much work remains to be done.\n\nThat's why we're launching a new initiative, \"Empowering Women,\" aimed at addressing these disparities and promoting gender equality.

As a valued member of our community, we wanted to share a report with you on the global state of women's rights and gender equality.\n\nAs you may know, progress towards gender equality has stalled in many parts of the world. The report, \"Women's Rights in 2023: A Global Report,\" highlights key trends and challenges facing women and girls today.\n\nThe report shows that although there have been some gains in recent years, significant disparities remain in areas such as education, health, economic participation, and political representation. In some regions, women and girls are facing increased violence and discrimination, with alarming rates of child marriage and female genital mutilation.\n\nAt [Sending Organization], we believe that all women and girls deserve to live free from discrimination and violence, and that equal rights and opportunities are essential for a fair and just society. That's why we have been working tirelessly to promote gender equality and women's rights around the world.\n\nAs a hero who cares about these issues, we need your help to continue our work.
