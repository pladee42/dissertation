Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.

Give me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive – reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals – about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

Our world is facing unprecedented challenges, and it's time for our governments to prioritize human rights and take meaningful action.\n\nThe International Human Rights Treaty, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1966, is a crucial foundation for protecting the most vulnerable members of our society. It covers topics such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and the right to a fair trial. However, in recent years, the treaty has been used to challenge governments' immigration policies, criminalize peaceful protests, and limit access to education and healthcare.\n\nThe time for complacency is over. Governments must prioritize human rights and act decisively to ratify the International Human Rights Treaty. Failure to do so will lead to a world where freedom of expression and equal rights for all are diminished.\n\nAs a fellow human rights advocate, I urge you to take action in support of ratifying the International Human Rights Treaty. Here are a few ways you can help:\n\n1. **Join the Campaign:** Visit our website [WEBSITE_URL] to learn more about the treaty and how you can help.\n\n2. **Write a Letter:** Write a letter to your local representatives and urge them to support ratification of the International Human Rights Treaty. You can find sample letters on our website.\n\n3. **Attend Events:** Attend rallies and protests to show your support for human rights. Visit our website [WEBSITE_URL] for upcoming events.\n\nTogether, we can create a world where human rights are protected and all individuals are treated equally. Let's stand up and fight for a better future for all.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[CONTRIBUTOR_EMAIL]\n\n---\n\n## Our Organization:\n\n[ORGANIZATION_NAME]\n\n---\n\n[ORGANIZATION_WEBSITE]\n[ORGANIZATION_social_media_handle]\n\n---\n\n---\n\n**CALL TO ACTION:**\n\nJoin us in supporting ratification of the International Human Rights Treaty by visiting our website [WEBSITE_URL] and taking action today.

Yet, this beacon of hope is dimmed by the shadow of non-ratification by some governments. Now, more than ever, your voice is crucial in lighting the way forward.\n\nThe treaty offers a blueprint for safeguarding fundamental rights, yet political inertia, legal hurdles, and public indifference stall progress.

Your advocacy can bridge the gap between the aspirations of the treaty and the realities on the ground.\n\nHere is how you can make a difference:\n\n- Reach out to your government representatives. Make it clear why the treaty's ratification is non-negotiable for you. Encourage your peers to do the same.\n- Use your voice on social media to raise awareness. Share facts, stories, and the significance of the treaty to inspire others to join the cause.\n- Support the movement by participating in events, signing petitions, and donating to organizations working tirelessly for human rights.\n\nYour commitment can turn the tide.

As leaders in AI for climate action, we invite you to join us in a pivotal movement.\n\nAI is not just a technological advancement; it's a beacon of hope for our environment.

As an esteemed advocate, your voice can galvanize communities, influence policy, and inspire innovation.\n\nConsider these actions:\n\n1. Partner with us to promote AI-based sustainability projects.\n2. Engage with your network to raise awareness about the importance of AI in climate solutions.\n3.
