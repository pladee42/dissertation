    "prompt": "## Instruction:\n\nYou are an expert email copywriter. Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.\n\nFinally, ensure the email is concise (under 500 words) and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. Give me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive – reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals – about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

The email needs to clearly communicate the new initiative, the problem it addresses, how the CEO and the organization plan to address it, and motivate the reader to act. Remember, the tone should be formal, yet inspiring.\n\n\n1. Begin by addressing the reader directly and acknowledging their support or interest in the company's journey.\n\n2. Clearly articulate the problem affecting the customer experience that the CEO-led initiative directly addresses.\n\n3. Outline the new customer experience initiative, including what sets it apart from previous efforts, the expected benefits, and how it aligns with the company's values and mission.\n\n4. Connect the initiative to the broader industry trends and how the company distinguishes itself.\n\n5. Provide a call to action that encourages the reader to participate in a specific way, be it through feedback, engagement, or support.\n\n6. Ensure the email closes with a powerful statement that reinforces the company's commitment to its customers and the future of its industry.\n\n7. Use persuasive language, without being overly salesy.\n\n8. Include a direct quote from the CEO that encapsulates the essence of the new initiative.\n\n9. The email should not contain any external links, but it must provide clear instructions on how the reader can learn more about the initiative within the email body itself.\n\n10. The closing should not just end the email; it should leave the reader with a lasting impression of the company's forward-thinking approach.\n\n## Response:\n\nSubject: A New Chapter for Customer Experience - Join Us in Shaping the Future\n\nDear [Recipient's Name],\n\nI hope this email finds you at a pinnacle of your creativity and enterprise.

With the rapid advancement of technology and the emergence of new customer expectations, we've recognized the urgent need to reimagine our approach to ensure a seamless, engaging, and personalized experience for every individual who interacts with our brand.\n\nIt is with great anticipation that I unveil our \"Revolutionizing Customer Experience\" initiative. Guided by a deep understanding of our customers' needs and aspirations, this groundbreaking effort will transform how we interact with our clients, making every touchpoint more intuitive, responsive, and tailored to their unique preferences.\n\nDist",
