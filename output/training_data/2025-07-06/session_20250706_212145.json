    "prompt": "## Instruction:\n\nYou are an expert email copywriter. Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.\n\nFinally, ensure the email is concise (under 500 words) and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. Give me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive – reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals – about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

As a valued member of our community, we wanted to bring to your attention a critical issue that affects us all: the ongoing deforestation and destruction of Indigenous lands in the Amazon Basin.\n\nThe fires in the Amazon are not only a tragedy for the people and wildlife that call this incredible region home, but they also contribute to climate change and threaten the health of communities around the world. For centuries, Indigenous peoples have cared for and protected the Amazon, and it's now more important than ever that we stand with them in their fight to protect their lands and way of life.\n\nOur organization, [Sending Organization], has been working tirelessly to advocate for the rights of Indigenous communities and to raise awareness about the urgent need to protect the Amazon. We're calling on individuals, organizations, and governments to take action and support our efforts.\n\nYou can be a hero in this fight. By joining our campaign, you'll be standing with us in solidarity and helping to amplify the voices of those most affected by this crisis.

This is the grim reality facing the Amazon Basin, where ancestral lands are under relentless threat. We at [Global Conservation Alliance], a leading organization in the fight for indigenous rights and environmental preservation, urgently need your support.\n\nThe Amazon is home to over 350 indigenous communities, each with unique languages, traditions, and a deep spiritual connection to their ancestral lands. These communities are the guardians of the rainforest, protecting its biodiversity and mitigating climate change. However, their way of life is at risk due to illegal logging, mining, and encroachment by large corporations.\n\nAs a member of the [Global Conservation Alliance], you are part of a powerful coalition that has successfully defended indigenous land rights around the world. We have provided legal support, raised awareness, and mobilized resources to protect these precious lands. But we can't do it alone.\n\nYour involvement can make a significant difference. By donating, volunteering, or simply sharing our cause, you can help us safeguard the Amazon Basin and its indigenous communities. Together, we can ensure their voices are heard, their rights are respected, and their way of life is preserved for future generations.\n\nTake action today and be the hero these communities need.

As a fervent protector of our planet's natural wonders, I'm reaching out to you with a heartfelt appeal. The Amazon Basin, a realm of unparalleled biodiversity and home to vibrant indigenous cultures, faces an unprecedented crisis that demands our collective action.\n\nThe indigenous peoples of the Amazon have nurtured the rainforest for millennia, fostering a symbiotic relationship that has allowed both the forest and its inhabitants to thrive. Today, however, they stand on the frontline against deforestation, illegal mining, and encroachment, as their ancestral lands are threatened by the machinations of greed and short-sighted development.\n\nAt [EcoDefenders], a non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation of our planet's ecosystems, we are actively working to protect the Amazon and its guardians. Our efforts encompass legal advocacy, community support, and global awareness campaigns, but we cannot accomplish these goals without you.\n\nYour voice, your time, and your resources are invaluable. Here's how you can contribute:\n\n1. **Donate**: Your financial support empowers us to continue our critical work on the ground.\n2. **Volunteer**: Share your expertise and passion by joining our team of dedicated individuals.\n3. **Spread the Word**: Use your influence to amplify our message and inspire others to join our cause.\n\nThe Amazon is not just a forest; it's a living, breathing entity that sustains life on Earth. By standing with us, you are not just saving a piece of land; you are ensuring the survival of countless species, including our own.\n\nWill you join us in this noble pursuit? Your support can turn the tide in this fight for preservation and justice. Click here to make a donation, here to find volunteer opportunities, or here to learn more about our ongoing projects.\n\nTogether, we can protect the Amazon and secure a future where its beauty and diversity continue to inspire and support life for generations to come.
