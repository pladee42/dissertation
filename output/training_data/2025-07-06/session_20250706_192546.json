    "prompt": "## Instruction:\n\nYou are an expert email copywriter. Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.\n\nFinally, ensure the email is concise (under 500 words) and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. Give me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive – reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals – about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

Our beloved sea turtles, who have thrived on Earth for millions of years, are facing a critical threat to their survival - pollution.\n\nDuring the nesting season, our beaches become a battleground for these majestic creatures. Plastic waste, littered debris, and discarded fishing gear pose a severe danger to the safety and well-being of sea turtle hatchlings. It's heartbreaking to witness these innocent lives struggling against a man-made crisis.\n\nAs part of our mission to protect sea turtles and their nesting grounds, we're hosting a volunteer-led cleanup event. GWC is dedicated to preserving our precious marine ecosystems, and we need passionate individuals like you to help us make a real difference.\n\nJoin us on [Date] at [Location] for an early morning cleanup event. We'll be providing all the necessary equipment and guidance to ensure a safe and productive experience. Together, we can remove harmful waste, restore the natural beauty of our beaches, and give sea turtles a fighting chance for survival.\n\nTo sign up, simply visit our website at [website link] and fill out the volunteer form. Your contribution will not only help save these incredible creatures but also contribute to a healthier and more sustainable marine environment for future generations.\n\nThank you for considering this vital cause. Together, let's protect our sea turtles and their nesting grounds.\n\nWith gratitude,\n\n[Your Name]\n[Your Position]\nGlobal Wildlife Conservation\n\n[Call to Action]\n\n[/EXAMPLE_EMAIL]\n\n## Response:\n\nSubject: Save Our Seas Turtles: Join the Beach Clean-Up!\n\nDear Friend of the Oceans,\n\nImagine walking along a serene beach, the sand warm beneath your feet and the sound of gentle waves in the distance. Now, picture that same beauty marred by plastic bottles, discarded fishing nets, and other litter, threatening the very existence of sea turtles that call these shores home.\n\nThis is the harsh reality our marine friends face. As a dedicated advocate for ocean conservation, I'm reaching out to you today from the team at Blue Wave Conservation (BWC) to ignite a spark of change. Our sea turtles need us, and we have a pressing mission to protect their nesting grounds.\n\nDuring their nesting season, these magnificent creatures face an increasingly hazardous challenge: pollution. As they lay their eggs on our beaches, they are burdened with the weight of human negligence. Plastic waste and other debris not only pose a threat to the hatchlings but also disrupt the delicate balance of our marine ecosystems.\n\nThe time to act is now. We're organizing a beach clean-up event that demands your participation. Our objective is simple: to rid our beaches of harmful waste and restore them to their natural, pristine state.\n\nJoin us on [Date] at [Location] for a morning filled with purpose and camaraderie. As volunteers, we'll provide the tools and guidance necessary to ensure a safe and effective clean-up operation. Together, we'll make a tangible difference in the lives of our sea turtles and contribute to the health of our oceans.\n\nTo register for this life-changing event, please visit our website at [website link]. Your involvement will not only help save our seas turtles but also inspire others to join our cause, creating a ripple effect of positive change.\n\nTogether, let's take a stand for our oceans and the remarkable creatures that inhabit them. Don't just stand by—act now and become a hero for our sea turtles.\n\nWith heartfelt thanks,\n\n[Your Name]\n[Your Position]\nBlue Wave Conservation\n\n[Call to Action]\n\n\n## Instruction:\n\nAs a technical writer, you are tasked with creating a detailed comparison chart for two leading smartphone brands, Brand A and Brand B, focusing on their camera systems.
