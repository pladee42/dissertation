    "prompt": "## Instruction:\n\nYou are an expert email copywriter. Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.\n\nFinally, ensure the email is concise (under 500 words) and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. Give me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive – reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals – about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

As a passionate advocate for childhood poverty, I am reaching out to you today to remind you of the critical need for summer camp scholarships for low-income kids.\n\nSummer is an essential time for children to develop social skills, foster independence, and build lasting memories. Unfortunately, low-income families can find themselves struggling to afford quality summer camps that provide these opportunities. According to recent statistics, nearly 1 in 5 children in the United States live in poverty, and many of them miss out on essential summer camps that can set them on a path to success.\n\nThat's why we are reaching out to you today. Your contribution can make a significant difference in the lives of these children and their families. By investing in summer camp scholarships, we can provide low-income kids with the support they need to thrive during this critical time.\n\nYour support will help us [INSERT BENEFITS OF DONATION HERE]. We can't do this without you.\n\nIf you're like us, you believe that every child deserves the opportunity to grow and thrive.

My child has always dreamed of attending summer camp and was thrilled when I found out about the amazing opportunities available. We’ve been fortunate enough to receive grants for my child’s tuition and we are deeply grateful for your organization’s work.\n\nUnfortunately, our financial situation has become strained, and we have been forced to make a difficult decision. We cannot afford to send our child to summer camp this year, and I fear that they will miss out on a life-changing experience. I am writing to appeal for your assistance in providing scholarships to low-income kids who would otherwise not have the opportunity to attend.\n\nI understand that summer camp can be expensive, but I believe that these scholarships will help our child and countless others who do not have the same financial resources. Your organization has a track record of providing financial support to underprivileged children, and I am confident that you will be able to provide my child with the same level of support they have provided for others.\n\nI have attached a flyer with more information about the scholarships and the application process. If you would like more information or to schedule a meeting with a member of our organization, please do not hesitate to contact me.
