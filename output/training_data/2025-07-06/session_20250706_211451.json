    "prompt": "## Instruction:\n\nYou are an expert email copywriter. Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.\n\nFinally, ensure the email is concise (under 500 words) and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. Give me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive – reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals – about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

Legal aid is crucial to these prisoners, who cannot afford private legal representation, and whose cases are often hopelessly complicated by the government's lack of transparency and accountability.\n\nAs you know, the Brazilian government has imprisoned many political prisoners, including leaders of the left-wing group, the Worker's Party. These prisoners have been detained without charge or trial, and are therefore unable to receive legal representation.\n\nWe believe that legal aid is essential for these prisoners to have a fair trial, to defend their rights, and to ensure that their cases are heard by an impartial court.\n\nWe are asking for your support to help provide legal aid to these prisoners. Every dollar donated will go directly towards providing legal representation and ensuring that these prisoners are afforded basic human rights.\n\nAs a charity, we rely on the generosity of donors like you to continue our critical work. Your donation will make a difference in the lives of these political prisoners and ensure that they receive the justice they deserve.\n\nPlease join us in supporting this important cause. Together, we can bring justice and hope to these prisoners and their families.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]\n\n[Your Title]\n\n[Your Sending Organization]\n\n[Your Email]\n\n[Your Phone Number]\n\n[Your Website] (Optional)\n\n[Your Signature]\n\n[Your Name]\n\n[Your Title]\n\n[Your Sending Organization]\n\n[Your Email]\n\n[Your Phone Number]\n\n[Your Website] (Optional)\n\n[Your Signature]\n\n[Your Name]\n\n[Your Title]\n\n[Your Sending Organization]\n\n[Your Email]\n\n[Your Phone Number]\n\n[Your Website] (Optional)\n\n[Your Signature]\n\n[Your Name]\n\n[Your Title]\n\n[Your Sending Organization]\n\n[Your Email]\n\n[Your Phone Number]\n\n[Your Website] (Optional)\n\n[Your Signature]",
