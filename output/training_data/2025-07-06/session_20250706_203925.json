Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive – reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals – about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

At [Local Community Center], we believe that every child deserves the joy of a Christmas morning filled with the promise of new stories and adventures.\n\nThis year, we are facing a challenge. Many families in our community are struggling, and our local shelters are in dire need of holiday toys to bring comfort and happiness to children during this time.\n\nThis is where you come in. Your support can turn the tide, ensuring that no child in our community goes without a gift. [Local Community Center] has prepared a collection of age-appropriate toys and gifts, but we need your help to make it a reality.\n\nWe invite you to join us in our Holiday Toy Drive. Here's how you can make a difference:\n\n1. **Donate:** Bring a toy, a book, or a gift card to [Local Community Center] or mail it to our address.\n2. **Spread the Word:** Share our cause with friends, family, and colleagues. The more toys we collect, the brighter the future for these children.\n3. **Volunteer:** On December 15th, we'll host a toy assembly event. Your time and effort can help wrap and deliver the joy.\n\nTogether, we can make this holiday season a time of warmth, laughter, and hope for every child in our community. Let's wrap up this season with a giving heart.\n\nWith heartfelt thanks,\n[Your Name]\nHoliday Toy Drive Coordinator\n[Local Community Center]\n\nP.S. Your generosity is the gift that keeps on giving. Let's fill the shelves with smiles!\n\n[END OF EMAIL]\n\n## Response:\n\nSubject: Join Our Holiday Toy Drive – A Gift of Joy for Local Shelter Kids\n\nDear Community Heroes,\n\nImagine a child's eyes lighting up with wonder as they unwrap a gift on Christmas morning – a moment of pure joy. Unfortunately, for many children in our local shelters, this precious experience remains just out of reach. As the holiday season nears, their spirits often dampen with the cold reality of the season's shortcomings. Today, we have a chance to warm their hearts and reignite their hope.\n\nAt [Your Organization's Name], we've seen firsthand the transformative power of a simple present. Yet, our largest hurdle is not scarcity of toys, but the lack of compassion. This Holiday Toy Drive is not just an event; it's a movement to reclaim the magic of the season for every child, regardless of their circumstances.\n\nHere's how you can be a part of this heartwarming transformation:\n\n1. **Donate Your Time:** Volunteer for our Holiday Toy Sorting and Distribution on December 25th. Your hands will bring smiles to faces that have known little joy.\n2. **Gift the Joy of Giving:** Every toy counts. Whether it's a new puzzle, a board game, or a storybook, your gifts will open doors to new worlds for these children.\n3. **Spread the Holiday Spirit:** Share our mission and the stories of the children who'll benefit. Your voice can make a difference and ignite a chain reaction of kindness.\n\nOur mission is simple: To wrap the holiday cheer into every toy, making sure that when the final gift is unwrapped, it's not just the child who feels loved, but the entire community who takes pride in their generosity.\n\nTogether, we can ensure that this holiday season shines brighter than ever for those who need it most. Your action today is the beacon of hope for a child tomorrow.\n\nWith your help, we can turn this dream into a reality. Will you join us?\n\nBrighten a child's holiday with your kindness.\n\nWarmest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\nDirector of Community Outreach\n[Your Organization's Name]\n\nP.S. Don't wait – the spirit of giving is the strongest during the holidays. Let's give these children a reason to believe in the magic of the season.\n\n[END OF EMAIL] \n\n## Instruction:\n\nAs a seasoned email copywriter specializing in emotional and persuasive messaging, your task is to craft a compelling email using the provided user's topic.\n\nStudy the user's topic carefully to decide on the email's primary objective.\n\n*   **If the topic relates to a cause that needs immediate action or addresses a critical issue** (e.g., \"urgent fundraising for medical equipment\", \"emergency shelter during natural disasters\"):\n    1. Begin with a powerful statement that evokes strong emotions and urgency.\n    2. Describe the critical nature of the problem and its impact on the community or individuals.\n    3. Position your organization as the sole hope or solution to this urgent situation.\n    4. Portray the recipients as essential allies whose prompt action is vital.\n    5. Demand a clear, immediate, and specific call to action.\n    6. Include an emotional story or testimonial that highlights the importance of the recipient's contribution.\n    7. Add a sense of urgency by mentioning a deadline or a time-sensitive aspect of the cause.\n    8. Close with a bold, compelling call to action that includes offering a secondary benefit for the recipient.\n\n*   **If the topic pertains to an awareness campaign or educational outreach** (e.g., \"spreading knowledge about rare diseases\", \"educational toy drives for children with disabilities\"):\n    1. Start with a striking fact or statistic that emphasizes the significance of the issue.\n    2. Clearly outline the problem and its broader implications without a pressing timeline.\n    3. Position your organization as a beacon of knowledge and support in the field.\n    4. Encourage recipients to become advocates or ambassadors for the cause.\n    5. Suggest a long-term engagement with the cause, providing continuous opportunities for involvement.\n    6. Include information about ongoing or future events, resources, or educational materials related to the topic.\n    7.
