    "prompt": "## Instruction:\n\nYou are an expert email copywriter. Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.\n\nFinally, ensure the email is concise (under 500 words) and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. Give me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive – reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals – about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

The user's topic is a campaign to promote sustainable living practices in urban environments.\n\n*   **If the topic is focusing on awareness or education** (e.g., \"the impact of single-use plastics\"):\n    1. Begin with a compelling fact or statistic that highlights the urgency of the issue.\n    2. Explain the problem and its consequences in detail, using relatable examples.\n    3. Introduce the campaign's organization and its role as a pivotal catalyst for change.\n    4. Emphasize the reader's critical role in this movement and the collective benefits of their action.\n    5. Appeal to the reader's values and sense of community by showing how individual actions contribute to a larger impact.\n    6. Include a clear and specific call to action that outlines exactly what the reader can do to contribute.\n\n*   **If the topic is about promoting a specific practice or change** (e.g., \"adopting a zero-waste lifestyle\"):\n    1. Start with a poignant question or scenario that challenges the reader's current perceptions.\n    2. Provide an overview of the specific practice and its significance in the context of sustainable living.\n    3. Detail the organization's initiatives and how they support the adoption of this practice.\n    4. Highlight the potential personal and societal benefits of making this change.\n    5. Paint a vivid picture of the positive outcomes that could result from widespread adoption.\n    6. Offer a straightforward call to action that guides the reader on how to start practicing this change.\n\nEnsure the email is exceptionally concise (under 400 words), and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. This time, include a rhetorical question, a quote, and an element of storytelling.

Imagine if each one of us could transform our urban lives into a testament of sustainability. The 'Green Urban Initiative' is here to turn that vision into reality.\n\nDid you know that urban areas contribute to 75% of global carbon emissions? It's a staggering figure that underscores the pressing need for change. Our campaign focuses on educating and empowering you, the urban dweller, to adopt practices that significantly reduce your carbon footprint.\n\nFrom the way we commute to the products we buy, every choice matters. Through our 'Urban Green Pledge', we aim to introduce you to simple, actionable steps that can lead to substantial environmental benefits. By working together, we can create a ripple effect that not only enriches our cities but also ensures a healthy planet for future generations.\n\nYour involvement could be the cornerstone of this transformation. By embracing practices like cycling to work, supporting local produce markets, or even just reducing water waste, you become an integral part of a collective effort that champions a sustainable urban lifestyle.\n\n\"The earth does not belong to us; we belong to the earth.\" This Native American proverb beautifully encapsulates the essence of our campaign—it's a call to respect and nurture our home.\n\n**",
