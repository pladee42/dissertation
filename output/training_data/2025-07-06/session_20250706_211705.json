    "prompt": "## Instruction:\n\nYou are an expert email copywriter. Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.\n\nFinally, ensure the email is concise (under 500 words) and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. Give me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive – reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals – about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

The email should not only inform but also educate, inspire action, and encourage donations to a newly founded non-profit organization.\n\nBefore you begin, consider the following constraints:\n\n1. **Complex Problem Identification**: Construct an opening that presents the issue in a multi-faceted way, acknowledging the economic, social, and health aspects.\n\n2. **Providing Evidence**: Incorporate recent statistics and findings to back up the issue.\n\n3. **Organization Representation**: Clearly state the non-profit's mission and how it differs from existing initiatives.\n\n4. **Personalization**: Address the recipient in a way that makes them feel directly involved in the issue's impact on their personal life.\n\n5. **Direct Call to Action**: The call to action should include three distinct steps, including donating, signing a petition, and volunteering.\n\n6. **Creative Elements**: Integrate a subtle storytelling element, such as a child's experience with fast food.\n\n7. **Closing Impact**: Conclude with a powerful statement that leaves a lasting impression, reinforcing the urgency of the cause.\n\n8. **Formatting and Tone**: The email must be structured with clear headings, bullet points for clarity, and a warm, yet urgent tone throughout.\n\n9. **Concise Language**: Despite the complexity, ensure the email remains concise, under 750 words.\n\n10. **Unique Visual Identity**: Include mention of an accompanying infographic that provides a visual representation of the impact of fast food on children's health.\n\n11. **Discount Incentive**: Offer a one-time discount for donations made within a specified timeframe.\n\n12. **Contact Information**: End with clear contact details for further inquiries.\n\n13. **Non-Profit's Testimonial**: Feature a testimonial from a parent whose child's health improved after participating in a non-profit program.\n\n## Response:\n\nSubject: Transforming Our Children's Health: Your Support is Vital\n\nDear [Recipient Name],\n\n**The Multi-Dimensional Crisis of Fast Food**\n\nOur children's health, society's well-being, and our economy's future are intertwined with a seemingly resilient adversary—fast food. While it provides convenience and affordability, it also contributes to a tide of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease among our youth.\n\n**Urgent Concerns Backed by Data**\n\n- Recent studies show a 20% increase in childhood obesity over the past five years, with fast food being a significant contributor.\n- Fast food consumption leads to a 15% higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes in children.\n\n**A Unique Approach by [Non-Profit Name]**\n\n[Non-Profit Name] goes beyond raising awareness; we provide accessible nutrition education, support healthy lifestyle programs, and advocate for policy change—setting us apart from conventional food reform efforts.\n\n**A Personal Connection**\n\nImagine little [Child's Name], whose laughter fills your home, now facing medical challenges due to fast food.
