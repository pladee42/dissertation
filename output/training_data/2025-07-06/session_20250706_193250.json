Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.\n\nFinally, ensure the email is concise (under 500 words) and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. Give me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive – reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals – about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

This isn't a dystopian fiction—it's the reality within factory farms.\n\nFactory farming is a cruel system where animals are treated as mere commodities, crammed into tiny spaces, and subjected to inhumane conditions. This not only leads to immense animal suffering but also poses serious health risks to consumers and the environment.\n\nWe, at [Organization Name], are fighting to end this abuse. Our campaign, [Campaign Name], aims to raise awareness, educate the public, and advocate for policy changes to protect animals' rights and welfare.\n\nBut we cannot do this alone. Your voice, your actions, and your choices matter. Here's how you can help:\n\n1. **Spread the word:** Share our campaign on social media, talk to your friends and family, and encourage them to join us in this fight for animal welfare.\n\n2. **Adopt a plant-based diet:** The single most effective way to reduce demand for factory-farmed products and improve animal welfare.\n\n3. **Support [Organization Name]:** Donate to our cause, volunteer your time, and help us turn the tide against factory farming.\n\nTogether, we can create a world where animals are treated with the respect and compassion they deserve. Join us in our campaign, [Campaign Name], and be a part of the movement for animal welfare.\n\nThank you for your support.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Organization Name]\n\n[/EXAMPLE_EMAIL]\n\n### Response:\n\nSubject: Stand with Us to Save Animals from Factory Farming\n\nDear Animal Advocate,\n\nEvery day, countless animals are confined in deplorable conditions within factory farms, their cries for help unheard by the world. This is not just an unfortunate reality—it's a crisis that demands our immediate action.\n\nIn these vast, windowless facilities, animals are treated not as sentient beings with rights and needs but as products to be maximized for profit. The impact of this system is devastating: animals live in overcrowded, filthy spaces, deprived of their natural behaviors and subjected to painful mutilations. The consequences extend beyond their suffering; factory farming is also responsible for polluting our environment and endangering human health.\n\nAt [Organization Name], we are committed to dismantling this cruel system and championing animal welfare. Our campaign, [Campaign Name], is dedicated to raising awareness, educating the public, and advocating for meaningful policy change. But we can't do it alone—we need you by our side.\n\nHere's how you can make a difference:\n\n1. **Spread the word:** Share our campaign on social media and engage in conversations with your friends, family, and colleagues about the importance of animal welfare.\n2. **Adopt a plant-based lifestyle:** Every meal you choose not to include animal products helps reduce the demand for factory-farmed goods and improves animal welfare.\n3. **Support [Organization Name]:** Your donations, time, and voice are crucial. They fuel our efforts to advocate for animals in need and help build a better future for them.\n\nWe believe that together, we can end the suffering of animals in factory farms and create a world where they are treated with the respect and care they deserve. Join our campaign, [Campaign Name], and become a champion for animal welfare.\n\nThank you for standing with us.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Organization Name]\n\n[/RESPONSE]\n\n### Instruction:\n\nTo generate an email copy based on the user's topic, follow these steps:\n\n1.
