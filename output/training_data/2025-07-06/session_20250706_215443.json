    "prompt": "## Instruction:\n\nYou are an expert email copywriter. Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.\n\nFinally, ensure the email is concise (under 500 words) and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. Give me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive – reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals – about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

As you know, public radio is a vital institution that provides a trusted source of information and entertainment to millions of people each and every day.\n\nOur mission is to support and sustain quality public radio programming, and this year, we are launching a year-end fundraising drive to help us achieve that goal.\n\nOur fundraising goal is $50,000, and we need your support to make it happen. For the past several years, we have been able to reach our fundraising goals, but that trend is about to come to an end. We need your help to keep the momentum going and ensure that we can continue to provide the best public radio programming to our listeners.\n\nHere's why:\n\n- We rely on listener donations to fund our programming. According to our recent annual report, we have received $3.5 million in listener donations over the past five years, which has allowed us to keep our programming fresh, engaging, and informative.\n- We have seen an increase in listener engagement with our programming over the years. According to our most recent survey, 75% of our listeners say they are more likely to listen to our programming if they donate.\n- Increased listener engagement means more listener support for our programming. We have seen an increase in listener donations overall, from 1,000 in 2019 to 1,940 in 2020.\n\nThe success of our fundraising drive will have a significant impact on our ability to provide quality public radio programming to you and your listeners for years to come.\n\nWe understand that this is a challenging year for many of you, and we want to ensure that we are able to continue supporting you and your communities. We appreciate your support during this time and hope that you will consider making a donation to our fundraising drive.\n\nTo help us reach our fundraising goal, we would greatly appreciate your support. You can make a donation online through our website at [LINK]. We appreciate your partnership in supporting quality public radio and in keeping our programming fresh and engaging.\n\nThank you for your continued support of public radio.\n\nBest regards,\n[SIGNATURE]\n[ORGANIZATION NAME]\n[COMPANY NAME]\n[EMAIL ADDRESS]",

This chilling prospect is what we're facing this year if we don't act now.\n\nAt [Your Radio Station Name], we strive to bring the best in music and arts programming to our listeners, enriching their lives and their communities. However, this year, due to unforeseen budget cuts, we face the imminent loss of these essential programs.\n\nThe challenge we face is daunting:\n\n- **Music shows:** Without your support, we will have to cancel our much-loved music sessions, depriving listeners of the joy and inspiration they bring.\n- **Arts segments:** Our cultural and arts segments, which bring local talent and diverse perspectives to our station, are at risk.\n- **Education:** Music and arts education programs, which nurture our community's creativity and talent, could be lost.\n\nYou, dear listener, are our hero this season. By donating to [Your Radio Station Name]'s **Year-End Fundraising Drive**, you are not merely giving money; you are giving hope. With your generosity, we can continue to offer these vital programs that touch the lives of our listeners every day.\n\nPlease visit [Donation Link] or call us at [Phone Number] to make your contribution today. Your donation, no matter how small, can make a significant difference in keeping our music and arts programming alive.\n\nThank you for being a part of our community. Together, we can ensure that our station remains a vibrant hub of music, arts, and education.\n\nWarm wishes,\n\n[Your Radio Station Name] Team\n\n[Call to Action]",
