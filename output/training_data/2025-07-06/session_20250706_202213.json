    "prompt": "## Instruction:\n\nYou are an expert email copywriter. Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.\n\nFinally, ensure the email is concise (under 500 words) and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. Give me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive – reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals – about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

This email is to be sent to a niche group of local farmers who are facing severe drought conditions. Your goal is to introduce a new drought-resistant crop variety that can thrive in these challenging conditions, making it essential for them to attend an informational webinar.\n\nThe email must adhere to the following constraints:\n\n1. Include a personalized greeting using the farmer's name and location.\n2. Use empathetic language to acknowledge the hardships caused by the drought.\n3. Clearly explain the benefits of the new crop variety, including increased resilience and potential for higher yields.\n4. Reference a recent study or testimonial from a respected agricultural expert who has successfully used the new crop variety.\n5. Highlight the webinar's key speakers, including their credentials and relevance to the farmers' situation.\n6. Include details about the webinar format, date, time, and how to register.\n7. Offer a special discount for first-time registrants to incentivize attendance.\n8. Use data and statistics related to the impact of drought on crop yields and the potential benefits of the new variety.\n9. End with a direct and bold call to action about registering for the webinar.\n\nEnsure that the email is concise, not exceeding 500 words, and maintains a tone of respect and support for the farmers' plight. The email should be presented in a format suitable for sending via email.\n\n### Example Email:\n\nSubject: Transform Your Farming Future - Discover Drought-Resistant Crops!\n\nDear [Farmer's Name],\n\nI hope this email finds you weathering the storm with resolve, as the recent drought has undoubtedly tested the resilience of our cherished Green Valley farmers. As a dedicated member of this community, we understand the challenges you face, and we want to offer a beacon of hope in these trying times.\n\nIntroducing the \"AquaCropGen\" variety – a groundbreaking drought-resistant crop that promises a new horizon for farmers like yourself. This innovative strain is engineered to thrive in water-scarce conditions, ensuring more consistent yields and reduced risk in uncertain weather patterns.\n\nDr. Amelia Fields, a renowned agronomist from the National Institute of Agricultural Research, recently conducted a comprehensive study on AquaCropGen. Her findings revealed that farms using this variety saw a 20% increase in yields compared to traditional crops under drought stress. The promise of AquaCropGen is not just in resilience but also in its potential to secure a sustainable future for your farm.\n\nJoin us on May 15th, from 9 AM to 11 AM, for an enlightening webinar titled \"Adapting to Change: Drought-Resistant Crops for Resilient Farming.\" Esteemed speakers include Dr. Fields, who will be sharing insights from her research, and John Green, a farmer from the Midwest who has successfully integrated AquaCropGen into his crop rotation, resulting in a remarkable turnaround for his farm.\n\nThis webinar will cover:\n\n- How AquaCropGen works and its benefits\n- Success stories from farmers who have adopted this variety\n- Practical tips for transitioning to drought-resistant crops\n- Q&A session with experts and fellow farmers\n\nYou can register for free here [Insert Registration Link], and as a first-time participant, you'll receive a 10% discount on future seminars.\n\nWe believe that together, we can secure a prosperous future for our farms and our community. Taking this step with AquaCropGen could be your first move towards a more resilient and sustainable farming practice.",
