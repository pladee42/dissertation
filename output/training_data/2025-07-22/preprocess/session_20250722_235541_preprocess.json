    "prompt": "## Instruction:\n\nYou are an expert email copywriter. Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.\n\nFinally, ensure the email is concise **(300 - 500 words)** and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. \n\n**IMPORTANT:** Generate exactly ONE complete email. Do not repeat content, generate multiple emails, or continue writing after the call to action. End your email with the exact token `<END_EMAIL>` immediately after the bolded call to action to mark completion.\n\nGive me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive \u2013 reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals \u2013 about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

This monumental decision marked a turning point in our nation's progress towards greater acceptance and understanding.\n\nSince then, countless couples across the United States have been able to marry their partners, share their love, and start families together. The impact of these marriages has been far-reaching, including increased stability, security, and financial benefits for both partners.\n\nBut there's still so much work to be done. Despite significant strides made by society, many same-sex couples still face discrimination and legal barriers when trying to build lasting relationships.\n\nThat's why I'm reaching out to you today. As a member of this community, you play a crucial role in advocating for equal rights and protections for all couples, regardless of their sexual orientation.\n\nPlease consider joining us in fighting for marriage equality. Whether it's sharing information about local ballot initiatives or attending rallies and events, every little bit counts. Together, we can make a difference and create a future where all couples are treated equally under the law.\n\nThank you for your continued support and advocacy.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]\n\nEND_EMAIL\n",

This historic moment was pivotal in setting legal precedents worldwide against discrimination faced by LGBTQ+ couples seeking recognition under marriage laws.\n\nEdith and Thea were pioneers when they challenged existing norms through civil disobedience; fighting tirelessly until society began acknowledging same-sex unions as valid partnerships deserving equal treatment both legally and societally. It took years before this courageous act bore fruit but look how far we have come since then \u2014 thanks largely due to these brave individuals standing tall amidst adversity while inspiring others around them toward acceptance rather than division among diverse communities living together harmoniously today because love knows no boundaries regardless if gender identity aligns perfectly between lovers involved within such relationships .
