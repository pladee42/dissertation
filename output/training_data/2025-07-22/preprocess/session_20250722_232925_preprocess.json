    "prompt": "## Instruction:\n\nYou are an expert email copywriter. Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.\n\nFinally, ensure the email is concise **(300 - 500 words)** and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. \n\n**IMPORTANT:** Generate exactly ONE complete email. Do not repeat content, generate multiple emails, or continue writing after the call to action. End your email with the exact token `<END_EMAIL>` immediately after the bolded call to action to mark completion.\n\nGive me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive \u2013 reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals \u2013 about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

It is my hope that by reading and following these tips, you will become a better ally to the bisexual community.\n\nBisexuality is a diverse and inclusive identity that encompasses both same-sex and opposite-sex attractions. In this guide, we will explore some of the ways in which being a bisexual ally can positively impact the bisexual community.\n\n1. Educate yourself: Bisexuals come in all shapes and sizes, and it\u2019s important to educate yourself about their experiences. Take courses, read books, and attend conferences to gain a deeper understanding of bisexuality.\n\n2. Listen actively: When speaking with bisexual people, listen actively to what they have to say. Don't assume that you know what they are going through simply because they are bisexual. Ask questions and listen intently.\n\n3. Support their identities: Bisexuals often face discrimination and harassment based on their sexual orientation. Be supportive of their identities and work towards creating a safe and accepting environment for them.\n\n4. Advocate for change: Bisexuals deserve equal rights and protections under the law. Work to advocate for policies that protect bisexual people and promote acceptance.\n\n5. Stay informed: Keep up-to-date with current events and news related to bisexuality. This will help you stay aware of issues affecting the bisexual community and how you can contribute to positive change.\n\n6. Show empathy: Bisexuals are just like anyone else. They have feelings, hopes, and dreams just like everyone else. Show empathy when interacting with them and avoid using labels that may make them feel uncomfortable.\n\n7. Connect with others: Join organizations and groups focused on supporting bisexual people. This will allow you to connect with other bisexual individuals who share similar experiences.\n\n8. Practice self-care: As a bisexual ally, practice self-care too. Eat well, exercise regularly, and get enough sleep to maintain good health.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this guide. I hope it helps you become a better bisexual ally.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n",
