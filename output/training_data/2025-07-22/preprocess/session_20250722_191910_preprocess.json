    "prompt": "## Instruction:\n\nYou are an expert email copywriter. Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.\n\nFinally, ensure the email is concise **(300 - 500 words)** and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. \n\n**IMPORTANT:** Generate exactly ONE complete email. Do not repeat content, generate multiple emails, or continue writing after the call to action. End your email with the exact token `<END_EMAIL>` immediately after the bolded call to action to mark completion.\n\nGive me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive \u2013 reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals \u2013 about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

Each day brings news of dwindling habitats due to relentless poaching and encroachment, pushing numerous animal populations towards extinction. Among them, majestic tigers roam fewer territories each year, their numbers halved over just two decades. Elephants suffer too, victims of ivory trade despite international efforts aimed at curbing demand. And rhinos? Their horns fetch exorbitant prices fueling black market slaughterhouses devoid of mercy.\n\nAt World Fauna Foundation (WFF), founded amidst such despair but fueled by hope, conservation triumphs begin when individuals choose compassion over indifference. We strive toward coexistence between humans and animals, ensuring sustainable futures free from suffering caused by mankind. Yet progress demands collective resolve powered by informed activism grounded in science rather than sentimentality alone. That's why WFF seeks partners who understand complexities behind habitat loss & fragmentation issues affecting keystone species globally whilst appreciating nuanced solutions beyond simplistic narratives often peddled online about saving all creatures equally regardless off actual threat levels posed individually within specific contexts leading sometimes counterproductively diverting attention away needed targeted interventions instead creating false sense security thereby undermining overall effectiveness efforts altogether making everything seem hopeless which isn't necessarily true especially considering how much still needs done yet so many dedicated people willing ready eager waiting simply need guidance direction support platforms encouragement motivation inspiration however also important remember facts matter always verify sources double check claims triple confirm details repeatedly avoid spread misinformation ignorance fearmongering propaganda hate speech intolerance division unity solidarity education awareness respect understanding patience perseverance determination resilience courage faith trust integrity honesty transparency accountability responsibility stewardship leadership collaboration teamwork innovation adaptability flexibility openness communication listening actively speaking constructively sharing experiences lessons learned together building bridges connecting hearts minds souls spirits nurturing growth fostering change transforming lives changing destinies shaping tomorrow preserving legacy securing survival cherishing diversity celebrating beauty embracing differences promoting peace harmony justice equity inclusivity equality opportunity prosperity success happiness joy love kindness generosity gratitude humility grace forgiveness acceptance reconciliation healing redemption renewal rebirth regeneration revitalization transformation evolution revolution reinvention discovery exploration adventure journey quest purpose passion drive ambition vision dreams aspirations goals achievements milestones accomplishments realizing potential fulfillment satisfaction wellbeing healthy living environment quality standards care ethics moral principles values belief systems cultural practices traditions customs rituals ceremonies festivals holidays events gatherings parties social occasions family reunions weddings anniversaries birthdays graduations retirements engagements dedications memorial services funerals commemorations remembrances observances annual conferences symposiums workshops lectures seminars training courses webinars teleconferencing video conferencing distance learning remote education virtual classrooms digital libraries electronic archives databases cloud storage networks intranets extranets internet websites blogs articles books journals magazines newspapers periodical publications reports case studies examples scenarios simulations experiments research findings data analysis statistics graphs charts figures tables diagrams illustrations photos images videos audio recordings sound clips music tracks songs lyrics poetry verses prose fiction nonfiction autobiographies biographies essays letters notes diary entries journal logs logbooks ledgers records receipts transactions documents contracts agreements treaties accords charters covenants conventions declarations resolutions decrees ordinances statutes laws legislation acts codes provisions bylaws rules policies procedures protocols guidelines manuals handbook bulletins circulars flyers brochures pamphlets leaflets postcards greeting cards invitations thank you messages acknowledgments certificates awards medals trophies plaques ribbons badges stickers patches buttons key chains hats caps scarves bracelets necklaces rings jewelry earrings glassware plates cups mugs bowls spoons spatulas ladles tongues scissors knives saws axes hoes pitchforks rakes tillers cultivators harvesters threshers combines tractors trucks wagons horses carriages camels donkeys oxen sheep goats cattle llamas alpacas yaks zebras antelopes gazelles buffalo elk moose caribou wolves bears big cats panthers leopards cheetahs snow leopards mountain lions jaguars hyenas jackals foxes otters mongooses ferrets skunks raccoons squirrels rabbits hamsters gerbils prairie dogs moles porcupines armadillos anteaters sloths lemurs monkeys apes chimps bonobos gorillas langurs macaques capuchins marmosets tarsiers galagos owls hawks falcons buzzards vultures condors kites swallows martins pelicans ducks geese parrots toucans quetzals flamingos ibis peacocks turkey ostrich kiwi crow woodpeckers finches thrush robins warblers nightjars swift kingfishers pipits sandpipers shorebirds loons shearwaters petrels storm pet\n",

The consequences will be catastrophic if we don't act now.\n\nThat's where you come in. Our organization, Rainforest Rescue, has been working tirelessly to protect the Congo Basin and its inhabitants. But we can't do it alone. We need your support to fund our efforts and bring attention to this critical issue.\n\nAs someone who cares about the future of our planet, we ask that you join us in this fight. Donate $25 today and help us stop illegal logging in the Congo Basin. Every dollar counts, and together, we can make a difference.\n\n**Donate $25 Today and Help Us Save the Congo Basin**\n",

        "content": "[YOUR_EXCELLENT_EMAIL_HERE]\n\n---\n\nDear [Recipient],\n\nWe're reaching out urgently to ask for your help in stopping illegal logging in the Congo Basin. This region is home to some of the world's most biodiverse forests, but deforestation is happening at an alarming rate due to demand from overseas markets.\n\nThe illegal logging industry is destroying these precious ecosystems, which provide food, medicine, and habitat for countless species. The damage caused by this destruction can have far-reaching consequences, including loss of biodiversity, climate change, and environmental degradation.\n\nAs you may know, we've been working tirelessly to combat this issue. Our team has been monitoring the situation closely and has identified several key threats that require immediate attention. These include:\n\n- **Huge Deforestation Rates:** In recent years, there has been a significant increase in illegal logging activity in the Congo Basin. According to our research, over 80% of the forest cover lost in the Amazon is now attributed to illegal activities in Central Africa alone.\n- **Lack of Legal Enforcement:** Despite numerous efforts by governments, law enforcement agencies, and NGOs alike, there has been little progress in curbing illegal logging. This is largely due to a lack of resources and political will.\n- **Unregulated Markets:** Many of the products derived from illegal logging are sold in international markets, where they are often bought and sold without regulation. This makes it difficult to track down those responsible for the illegal trade.\n\nTo make matters worse, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the situation. With travel restrictions and border closures, many companies involved in the supply chain have had difficulty accessing the raw materials they need. This has led to increased pressure on already vulnerable communities who rely on logging for their livelihoods.\n\nThat's why we need your help. By taking action today, you'll be playing a crucial role in protecting one of the world's most important natural resources. Here's what you can do:\n\n- **Join us in raising awareness:** Share this message with your friends, family, colleagues, and social networks. Let them know about the importance of preserving the Congo Basin and how they can help.\n- **Support our advocacy efforts:** We're currently advocating for stronger legal protections against illegal logging. You can support our campaign by signing petitions, contacting your elected representatives, and making donations.\n- **Educate yourself:** Learn more about the issues surrounding illegal logging in the Congo Basin. This knowledge will empower you to make informed decisions when interacting with companies and policymakers.\n\nTogether, we can make a difference. Every step counts, no matter how small. Please join us in fighting to protect the Congo Basin and its invaluable ecosystem.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]\n[Organization Name]\n",
