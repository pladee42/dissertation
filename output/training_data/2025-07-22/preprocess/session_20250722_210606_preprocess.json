    "prompt": "## Instruction:\n\nYou are an expert email copywriter. Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.\n\nFinally, ensure the email is concise **(300 - 500 words)** and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. \n\n**IMPORTANT:** Generate exactly ONE complete email. Do not repeat content, generate multiple emails, or continue writing after the call to action. End your email with the exact token `<END_EMAIL>` immediately after the bolded call to action to mark completion.\n\nGive me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive \u2013 reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals \u2013 about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

The ocean covers approximately 71% of Earth's surface and provides us with oxygen, food, and livelihoods. Unfortunately, over the past few decades, human activities have led to significant degradation of our ocean ecosystems.\n\nAs a concerned citizen and member of this community, I urge you to join me in creating a new marine protected area that will safeguard some of the most pristine areas where our fish populations thrive. These areas provide critical habitat for many species at risk, including sharks, sea turtles, and dolphins.\n\nThe proposed location for this protected area includes [insert specific details], which has been identified by conservationists as a vital ecosystem for maintaining healthy fish stocks and supporting local economies.\n\nBy joining this campaign, you can make a difference in protecting these areas and ensuring their long-term survival. You'll be contributing to efforts to conserve marine life and support sustainable fishing practices.\n\nHere are three easy ways to get involved:\n\n1.

As an avid ocean lover, I am deeply concerned about the damage being done to our planet\u2019s oceans. We need to do everything we can to protect these vital ecosystems and ensure their sustainability for future generations.\n\nOur petition seeks to create a new marine protected area that will safeguard the health of our oceans by preserving critical habitats and species. This initiative would be a significant step towards ensuring the survival of our marine life and promoting environmental conservation.\n\nWe believe that this proposed area should be established in the waters surrounding the island nation of [INSERT ISLAND NAME]. The island is home to some of the most diverse marine ecosystems in the world, including coral reefs, seagrass beds, and mangrove forests. These habitats provide a crucial habitat for many marine species, including sea turtles, sharks, and dolphins.\n\nThe proposed area would also benefit from increased protection measures such as prohibiting fishing activities within the designated zone, enforcing strict laws against plastic pollution, and implementing conservation programs to promote sustainable tourism practices.\n\nAs you know, there are already several existing marine protected areas in the region, but they are not adequately funded and staffed to manage them effectively. Our proposed area would require additional resources and personnel to ensure its effective management and protection.\n\nWe are asking you to join us in supporting this initiative and to take action to ensure the establishment of this new marine protected area. We believe that this will be a significant step towards preserving our oceans for future generations.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n",
