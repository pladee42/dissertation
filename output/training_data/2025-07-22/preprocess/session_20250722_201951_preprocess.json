    "prompt": "## Instruction:\n\nYou are an expert email copywriter. Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.\n\nFinally, ensure the email is concise **(300 - 500 words)** and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. \n\n**IMPORTANT:** Generate exactly ONE complete email. Do not repeat content, generate multiple emails, or continue writing after the call to action. End your email with the exact token `<END_EMAIL>` immediately after the bolded call to action to mark completion.\n\nGive me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive \u2013 reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals \u2013 about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

        "content": "[Your Name]\nSubject: World Oceans Day: A Call to Reduce Your Plastic Footprint\n\nDear [Recipient],\n\nAs we celebrate World Oceans Day on June 8th, I wanted to share some important information about plastic pollution in our oceans. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), there are now over 8 million tons of plastic waste in our oceans every year, with plastic bags, straws, and other single-use items being the most common culprits. This is a serious issue that requires immediate attention.\n\nIn response, I would like to encourage you to make a small but meaningful change in your daily life. Here are some ways you can reduce your plastic footprint:\n\n1. Bring reusable bags instead of using disposable ones.\n2. Choose products made from recycled materials or biodegradable plastics.\n3. Turn off lights and unplug electronics when not in use.\n4. Avoid buying products packaged in plastic.\n5. Support organizations that work towards reducing plastic waste.\n\nThe impact of these small changes can be significant. For instance, a study by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation found that if all plastic packaging were replaced with reusable alternatives, it could prevent up to 70% of ocean plastic from entering our oceans.\n\nTo make this effort even easier, I am offering a special discount code for my readers. Simply use the code \"WOODY\" at checkout to receive 10% off your purchase until June 9th.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this email. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further information.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n",

The oceans face unprecedented threats due to plastic waste choking marine life and disrupting ecosystems worldwide. But there is hope; every individual can make a difference by reducing their reliance on single-use plastics.\n\nThe alarming rate at which oceanic creatures ingest microplastics has led us down a dangerous path where even remote islands like Midway Atoll bear witness to devastating consequences. These tiny particles accumulate within fish tissues, eventually reaching humans through seafood consumption \u2013 posing significant health risks over time. Moreover, larger debris fragments become hazardous navigational obstructions threatening both aquatic species and maritime safety alike.\n\nIt falls upon each one of us today \u2014and beyond\u2013to act decisively towards safeguarding Earth\u2019s precious waterscapes before irreversible damage takes hold permanently. By choosing reusable alternatives such as bamboo straws instead of disposable ones made from non-biodegradable materials , opting out of excess packaged goods whenever possible, recycling diligently...these simple yet impactful actions collectively contribute toward preserving vital habitats teeming with diverse forms of life found nowhere else but underwater realms across continents . Let us pledge ourselves once again around World Oceans Day celebrations into becoming conscientious stewards who prioritize sustainability above convenience while raising awareness amongst friends family colleagues acquaintances about how small changes matter immensely given current environmental challenges facing global communities together..\n\nTogether let's turn backtime trends & create
