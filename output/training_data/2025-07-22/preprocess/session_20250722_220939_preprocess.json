    "prompt": "## Instruction:\n\nYou are an expert email copywriter. Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.\n\nFinally, ensure the email is concise **(300 - 500 words)** and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization. \n\n**IMPORTANT:** Generate exactly ONE complete email. Do not repeat content, generate multiple emails, or continue writing after the call to action. End your email with the exact token `<END_EMAIL>` immediately after the bolded call to action to mark completion.\n\nGive me the full email only, without any introductory text or ending text.\n\n## User's Request:\n\n*   **[TOPIC]:**\n\n## Example:\n\nDefender,\n\nPolar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!\nCritical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil's planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive \u2013 reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region's declining bear population.\nYour representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!\n\nTAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!\n\nFriend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.\nBut polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals \u2013 about half as many bears as three decades ago.\nOil exploration on the Refuge's coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears' survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears' snow caves to collapse.\nDon't let polar bears die for Big Oil's profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!\n\nThe Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge's coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.\nCongress needs to do what the Trump administration won't. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.\nThank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.\n\nSincerely,\n[Name]\n[Position]\n[Company]",

This worrying reality affects countless students across our nation who deserve nothing less than safe learning environments where they can thrive academically and personally. The time has come for us to stand up together against this pressing issue by supporting legislation like the Safe Schools Improvement Act (SSIA). As constituents deeply concerned about student well-being, we implore you to advocate fervently for SSIA within Congress.\n\nThe current state of affairs leaves too many children vulnerable; bullying incidents have escalated while resources allocated towards prevention remain woefully insufficient. With schools becoming targets for violence, comprehensive policies must evolve swiftly if we aim to safeguard young lives effectively. It falls upon lawmakers such as yourself \u2014 entrusted guardians representing their communities \u2014to spearhead these crucial reforms through supportive measures including but not limited to enhanced training programs for educators handling disciplinary actions responsibly yet compassionately.\n\nWe understand there may exist hesitations regarding policy implementation costs associated with bolstering security protocols alongside counselor availability enhancements required under proposed amendments found herein.[LINK TO PROPOSED AMENDMENTS]. However, let us consider how much greater would financial investment truly cost when juxtaposed against potential losses stemming directly out of negligence toward proactive solutions?

Yet, despite progress made, millions of American students face threats each year because vital protective laws haven't been passed. We need decisive leadership from someone willing to act quickly and courageously, which brings us straight to you, my esteemed representative, and why I believe you hold the key to change. By backing critical initiatives like the Safe Schools Improvement Act (SSIA), you possess the power to create lasting impact, transforming perilous conditions into bastions of education excellence. Let's rally behind one another so all children feel empowered to focus solely on growing intellectually, socially, emotionally, and physically free from anxiety caused by unsafe surroundings. Please make sure to express strong support for robust anti-violence strategies during Congressional discussions concerning childhood development priorities. Together, we will pave pathways leading away from hazards threatening academic growth and overall life quality among America's future leaders.

But right now, there's a critical issue threatening the well-being of students across America: the lack of clear guidelines for addressing gun violence in schools. That's why I'm reaching out to you today.\n\nThe Safe Schools Improvement Act (SSIA) is a bipartisan bill that would provide much-needed resources to improve school safety and prevent gun violence. It requires schools to develop comprehensive emergency response plans, receive regular mental health services, and establish anonymous reporting systems for threats of violence. This legislation is crucial to ensuring our kids feel safe at school and giving educators the tools they need to protect them.\n\nUnfortunately, SSIA has been stalled in Congress since its introduction in 2019. We cannot afford to wait any longer for this vital legislation to pass. Our children's lives depend on it.\n\nThat's why I am calling on you, as my representative, to support the Safe Schools Improvement Act and do everything in your power to see it through. As a member of Congress, you have the unique opportunity to make a difference in the lives of millions of American students. Be their champion and stand up for what's right.\n\nPlease, take a moment to contact your senator today and ask them to co-sponsor the Safe Schools Improvement Act. You can reach them by phone ([PHONE\\_NUMBER]) or by filling out the form on their website ([WEBSITE\\_LINK]). Let them know that you expect them to prioritize the safety of our children and vote in favor of the Safe Schools Improvement Act.\n\nTogether, we can create a safer environment for our kids to learn and grow. Don't let them down. Stand with us and be a hero for our students.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n",
