Hi [Name],  

Imagine a world where polar bears roam freely, their white coats glistening against the Arctic ice. But this world is slipping away. With their habitats melting at an alarming rate, these majestic creatures are fighting for survival. The University of Sheffield's Polar Bears Rescue team is on the front lines, but we can’t do it without you.  

**The Problem:**  
Every year, the Arctic ice that polar bears depend on is disappearing at a rate of 13% per decade. This isn’t just a problem for the bears – it’s a stark warning for our planet. Climate change, driven by corporate greed and political inaction, is destroying their homes and threatening their future.  

**The Solution:**  
We’re not just fighting for polar bears – we’re fighting for a sustainable future. Your support can help us fund critical research, protect their habitats, and advocate for stronger environmental policies.  

**How You Can Help:**  
Your donation will directly support:  
- Essential research to understand polar bear populations  
- Efforts to protect their shrinking habitats  
- Advocacy for policies that combat climate change  

**Urgency:**  
Time is running out for polar bears. With your help, we can make a difference before it’s too late.
