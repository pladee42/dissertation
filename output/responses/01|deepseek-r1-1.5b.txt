Hi Everyone,

Did you know that nearly 8 million people worldwide were left homeless during the COVID-19 pandemic? While countless individuals contributed to building shelters and providing food, half of these shelters remained empty. Corforgments continue to cut funding to protect these animals, manipulating policies to displace populations, and causing severe environmental damage that threatens their survival. Yet, hope hasn’t waned—over 70% of families living near these ecosystems currently survive daily.

We are incredibly proud to stand alongside these remarkable creatures, and your support plays a pivotal role in stopping this catastrophic event. Imagine the power we wield when we give money, collaborate with partners, and demand accountability—each small gesture is meaningful.

Join us in preserving the future of polar bears. Your contributions matter today. Now is the time to act—we cannot afford to delay. Let’s go out tonight to raise awareness, fundraise, and drive awareness across boundaries. Together, we can turn silence into action.

Thank you for choosing us to save the lives of these incredible beings. We look forward to learning from you soon and hoping to see you donate today.
