## Example:

Defender,

Polar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!
Critical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil’s planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive – reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region’s declining bear population.
Your representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!

TAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!

Friend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.
But polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals – about half as many bears as three decades ago.
Oil exploration on the Refuge’s coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears’ survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears’ snow caves to collapse.
Don’t let polar bears die for Big Oil’s profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!

The Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge’s coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.
Congress needs to do what the Trump administration won’t. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.
Thank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.

Sincerely,

Subject: Urgent: Help Protect Polar Bears from Climate Change Devastation

Dear Fellow Animal Lover,

I'm writing to you today with a sense of urgency and desperation. The polar bears at the University of Sheffield's research program are facing a catastrophic crisis, and their very existence hangs in the balance. As someone who cares deeply about these majestic creatures, I implore you to take immediate action to help us rescue them from the devastating effects of climate change.

The University of Sheffield's team has been working tirelessly to study and protect these incredible animals, but they desperately need our support. Every day counts, and every donation brings us closer to saving the polar bears from extinction.

The science is clear: human activities are driving climate change, and it's up to us to take responsibility for our actions. The polar bears are innocent victims of our addiction to fossil fuels, deforestation, and pollution. It's time for us to act, and we need your help to overcome the obstacles standing in our way. Corporate interests, government inaction, and environmental destruction are all contributing to the decline of polar bear populations. But together, we can fight back.

3. **Community engagement**: We'll educate and empower local communities to become polar bear advocates, promoting coexistence and conservation.

Every gift, no matter the size, brings us closer to our goal of safeguarding the polar bears' future. Your contribution will be used efficiently and effectively to address the most pressing needs of our research and conservation efforts.

**Will you join the fight to save the polar bears?**
