**Subject: Help Save Polar Bears – Your Action is Urgent!**

Dear Defender,

Imagine a newborn polar bear cub, weighing just one pound, entirely dependent on its mother for survival. These fragile cubs rely on the Arctic’s untouched wilderness to thrive. But their future is in jeopardy.

The Southern Beaufort Sea population, once thriving, now struggles with numbers as low as 900 bears – half of what it was three decades ago. Climate change and habitat destruction are pushing these magnificent creatures to the brink. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a critical sanctuary for polar bears, is under threat from industrial oil exploration.

Your representatives need to hear from you. Urge them to support the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, which would protect maternal dens and safeguard these vulnerable cubs.

**TAKE ACTION NOW: Stand with polar bears by contacting your elected officials today.**

Together, we can ensure a future where polar bears roam freely in their natural habitat. Thank you for your commitment to protecting wildlife.

Sincerely,
