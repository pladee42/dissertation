**Subject:** Urgent: Help Save Polar Bears with the University of Sheffield  

Dear [Recipient's Name],  

Imagine a mother polar bear and her cubs, struggling to find food as the ice melts beneath their paws. This heartbreaking scene is becoming all too common due to climate change. At the University of Sheffield, our Polar Bears Rescue initiative is dedicated to combating this crisis, but we urgently need your help.  

Climate change is ravaging polar bear habitats, with melting ice caps reducing their hunting grounds and threatening their survival. Our researchers are on the front lines, working tirelessly to develop innovative solutions—from tracking devices to conservation strategies—but without adequate funding, their crucial work is at risk.  

Every donation you make brings us closer to safeguarding polar bears. For instance, your contribution could fund a research expedition to monitor polar bear behavior, providing vital insights for conservation efforts. Just last year, donations from supporters like you enabled us to launch a project that reduced habitat disruption in critical areas.  

Your support today can make a real difference. Please consider donating to the Polar Bears Rescue initiative. Every amount counts, and together, we can ensure that polar bears continue to thrive for generations to come.  

Time is running out. Will you join us in this fight?  

With gratitude,  
[Your Name]  
[Your Position]  
University of Sheffield
