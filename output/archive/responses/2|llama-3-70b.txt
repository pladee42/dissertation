## Example:

Defender,

Polar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!
Critical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil’s planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive – reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region’s declining bear population.
Your representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!

TAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!

Friend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.
But polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals – about half as many bears as three decades ago.
Oil exploration on the Refuge’s coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears’ survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears’ snow caves to collapse.
Don’t let polar bears die for Big Oil’s profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!

The Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge’s coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.
Congress needs to do what the Trump administration won’t. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.
Thank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.

Sincerely,

Subject: Urgent: Help Us Save the Polar Bears of the Arctic

Dear Defender of the Wild,

Imagine a world where polar bears roam free, their icy habitats untouched and pristine. But sadly, that world is disappearing before our eyes. Climate change, driven by human activities, is melting the Arctic ice at an alarming rate, leaving polar bears without a home. The University of Sheffield's Polar Bears Rescue initiative is racing against time to protect these majestic creatures, and we urgently need your support.

As I write this, polar bears are struggling to find food, shelter, and breeding grounds. The consequences of inaction will be catastrophic: malnutrition, reduced reproduction rates, and eventually, extinction. It's a grim reality that we cannot ignore. The science is clear: human-induced climate change is the primary driver of this crisis, and it's up to us to act.

That's why the University of Sheffield has launched the Polar Bears Rescue initiative, a comprehensive program aimed at mitigating the effects of climate change on polar bear populations. Our team of experts is working tirelessly to develop innovative solutions, from reducing carbon emissions to preserving Arctic habitats. However, we cannot do it alone. We need your help to overcome the obstacles that stand in our way.

Corporate greed, political inaction, and environmental destruction are just a few of the challenges we face. But together, we can overcome them. Your donation will be used to support cutting-edge research, conservation efforts, and community engagement initiatives. Every contribution, no matter how small, brings us closer to our goal of protecting polar bears and their habitats.

Here are some ways your donation can make a difference:

* $10: Supports research into the impacts of climate change on polar bear behavior and ecology
* $50: Helps develop educational programs for local communities, promoting coexistence with polar bears
* $100: Contributes to the creation of protected areas, safeguarding polar bear habitats

The clock is ticking. We have a narrow window of opportunity to act, and every moment counts. Will you join us in this fight? Your support is crucial in helping us:

* Conduct vital research into polar bear behavior and ecology
* Develop effective conservation strategies
* Engage local communities in polar bear conservation efforts

Take action today and help us ensure the long-term survival of polar bears. Donate now and become a part of our mission to protect these incredible animals.
