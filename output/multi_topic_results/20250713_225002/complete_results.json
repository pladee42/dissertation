Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic, incorporating the additional constraints provided.\n\nFirst, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.\n\n*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., \"saving wildlife,\" \"defending human rights\"):\n    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook that uses a story or a striking fact.\n    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it, incorporating statistics or recent events to emphasize its severity.\n    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution, including specific initiatives or actions they are undertaking.\n    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential, using inspiring language that calls upon their values.\n    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action, providing multiple avenues for involvement to suit different levels of commitment.\n    6.  Include a testimonial or success story from someone who has already contributed to the cause to reinforce the call to action.\n\n*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., \"our new podcast,\" \"upcoming festival\"):\n    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening that connects the reader to the content or event on a personal level.\n    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event, highlighting what makes it unique or valuable.\n    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more, using persuasive language that emphasizes the benefits of attending or engaging with the content or event.\n\nThen, ensure the email is concise (under 500 words) and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization.

This bill, if passed, will ensure that polar bears have better chances at survival and thrive in their Arctic habitat.\n\nHere's why we need your support:\n\n- Polar bears are facing an alarming decline in population due to the effects of climate change on their food and habitat.\n- The Arctic is warming at an unprecedented rate, and polar bears are particularly vulnerable to these changes.\n- The Polar Bear Cub Survival Act would provide critical resources to protect these bears' future survival.\n\nAs the polar bear population has been declining for decades, we need to take immediate action to safeguard their future.\n\nYou can help us by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act. By signing the petition, you will show your support for our cause and urge your government to take action.\n\nPlease sign the petition today and let the world know that you care about polar bears.\n\nThank you for your support.\n\nBest,\n\n[Your Name]\n\n[Your Title]\n\n[Your Email]\n\n[Your Organization]",

This bill, if passed, will ensure that polar bears have better chances at survival and thrive in their Arctic habitat.\n\nHere's why we need your support:\n\n- Polar bears are facing an alarming decline in population due to the effects of climate change on their food and habitat.\n- The Arctic is warming at an unprecedented rate, and polar bears are particularly vulnerable to these changes.\n- The Polar Bear Cub Survival Act would provide critical resources to protect these bears' future survival.\n\nAs the polar bear population has been declining for decades, we need to take immediate action to safeguard their future.\n\nYou can help us by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act. By signing the petition, you will show your support for our cause and urge your government to take action.\n\nPlease sign the petition today and let the world know that you care about polar bears.\n\nThank you for your support.\n\nBest,\n\n[Your Name]\n\n[Your Title]\n\n[Your Email]\n\n[Your Organization]",
