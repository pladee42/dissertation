Defender,

Polar bear cubs could get the protection they need to survive thanks to a new bill. Tell your elected officials to support this legislation to save these bears!
Critical habitat for polar bears is threatened by Big Oil’s planned industrial invasion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. These bears are already struggling to survive – reckless oil development could be the final nail in the coffin for the region’s declining bear population.
Your representatives need to hear from you right now. Urge them to support this legislation to keep imperiled polar bears safe!

TAKE ACTION: Demand your elected officials protect vulnerable cubs by supporting the Polar Bear Cub Survival Act!

Friend of Defenders, a newborn polar bear cub only weighs about one pound. These cubs are completely dependent on their mother for nutrition and warmth. They are not strong enough to survive outside of their den.
But polar bears are in serious trouble. Many populations are in freefall: The Southern Beaufort Sea population that depends on the security of the habitat provided by the Arctic Refuge now numbers as few as 900 individuals – about half as many bears as three decades ago.
Oil exploration on the Refuge’s coastal plain is a direct threat to these bears’ survival. The Refuge is where pregnant mother bears go to build maternal dens and give birth. Seismic exploration for oil alone could lead to bears being crushed in their dens as 90,000-pound earthquake-inducing thumper trucks cause the bears’ snow caves to collapse.
Don’t let polar bears die for Big Oil’s profits. Support legislation to keep these bears safe!

The Polar Bear Cub Survival Act, if passed, would create a buffer banning oil development around polar bear maternal denning habitat on the Arctic Refuge’s coastal plain to ensure denning mothers and cubs are protected.
Congress needs to do what the Trump administration won’t. They need to protect one of the most imperiled polar bear populations in the world from dangerous plans to industrialize their critical denning habitat.
Thank you in advance for your dedication to protecting wildlife.

Sincerely,
