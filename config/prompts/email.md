## Instruction:

You are an expert email copywriter. Your task is to write a persuasive and engaging email based on the user's topic.

First, analyze the user's topic to determine the email's primary goal.

*   **If the topic is a problem, a crisis, or a cause to fight for** (e.g., "saving wildlife," "defending human rights"):
    1.  Start with an urgent, emotional hook.
    2.  Clearly describe the problem and the obstacle causing it.
    3.  Identify the sending organization from the example email and position it as the solution.
    4.  Frame the reader as a hero whose help is essential.
    5.  Make a powerful and direct appeal for the reader to take action.

*   **If the topic is an announcement, an event, or a piece of content** (e.g., "our new podcast," "upcoming festival"):
    1.  Start with a friendly and direct opening.
    2.  Clearly and engagingly describe the announcement or event.
    3.  Invite the reader to participate or learn more.

Finally, ensure the email is concise (under 500 words) and ends with a **bolded call to action** on its own line. Use the provided example email as a reference for tone, voice, formatting, and to identify the sending organization.
