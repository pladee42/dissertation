# Final Validation Protocol - Stage 1: Core Statistical Analysis

This folder implements Stage 1 of the Final Validation Protocol analysis framework for three-way model comparison (Baseline vs DPO-Synthetic vs DPO-Hybrid).

## Files

### `effect_size_calculator.py`
- Calculates Cohen's d with confidence intervals
- Computes η² (eta squared) for ANOVA results
- Interprets effect sizes using Cohen's conventions
- Validates against methodology predictions:
  - Baseline vs DPO-Synthetic: d = 0.5-0.7 (medium)
  - Baseline vs DPO-Hybrid: d = 0.7-1.0 (large)
  - DPO-Synthetic vs DPO-Hybrid: d = 0.3-0.5 (small-medium)

### `three_way_comparison_analysis.py`
- Main analysis script for complete statistical framework
- Paired t-tests with Bonferroni correction
- One-way ANOVA with η² calculation
- Data validation and quality checks
- Summary statistics and formatted reporting

## Usage

### With your data files:
```bash
python three_way_comparison_analysis.py \
  --baseline path/to/baseline_results.json \
  --synthetic path/to/synthetic_results.json \
  --hybrid path/to/hybrid_results.json
```

### With example data:
```bash
python three_way_comparison_analysis.py --example
```

### Test effect size calculator:
```bash
python effect_size_calculator.py
```

## Expected Data Format

The analysis expects `complete_results.json` files with structure:
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "topic_id": "T0001",
      "emails": [
        {
          "evaluation": {
            "overall_score": 0.75
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Output

The analysis provides:

1. **Summary Statistics**: Descriptive statistics for all three models
2. **Paired t-tests**: Statistical significance between all model pairs
3. **ANOVA Results**: Overall three-way comparison with η²
4. **Effect Sizes**: Cohen's d with confidence intervals
5. **Methodology Validation**: Whether results match theoretical predictions

## Methodology Validation Criteria

- **Effect Size Ranges**: Cohen's d values within predicted ranges
- **ANOVA Threshold**: η² > 0.06 for meaningful effect
- **Overall Status**: PASS if all criteria met, PARTIAL otherwise

## Implementation Notes

- Uses paired t-tests (assumes same topics across models)
- Applies Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons
- Validates data quality and sample sizes
- Provides clear pass/fail validation against methodology

This implements the core statistical framework required for PhD-quality validation of the optimization methods described in the Final Validation Protocol.
