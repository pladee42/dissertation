- Updated Table 2 with new effect sizes and CIs

✅ Task 4: Update Effect Size Analysis
- Updated Cohen's d values:
  * Baseline vs Synthetic: d=-0.065 [-0.240, 0.111]
  * Baseline vs Hybrid: d=-0.056 [-0.231, 0.119]
  * Synthetic vs Hybrid: d=0.011 [-0.164, 0.187]
- Updated largest effect size: 0.079 → 0.065
- Revised interpretation text

✅ Task 5: Update Model-Specific Tables
- Added M0004 (Llama-3-8B) to Table 3
- Updated all model statistics:
  * M0001: -3.4% (Synthetic), -5.3% (Hybrid)
  * M0002: -10.2% (Synthetic), -3.8% (Hybrid)
  * M0003: +3.8% (Synthetic), +3.4% (Hybrid)
  * M0004: +41.3% (Synthetic), +38.6% (Hybrid) - LARGEST
  * M0005: -8.1% (Synthetic), -12.0% (Hybrid)
- Updated model architecture analysis text

✅ Task 6: Update Category Analysis
- Updated Table 4 with new category statistics:
  * Healthcare/Medical: N=60, -6.9% (S), +4.6% (H)
  * Education/Youth: N=65, -3.8% (S), +1.6% (H)
  * Environmental: N=60, +17.5% (S), +4.8% (H)
  * Community/Social: N=65, +6.0% (S), -0.8% (H)
- Revised category improvement descriptions

ADDITIONAL UPDATES
==================================================

✅ Figure Caption Updates
- Updated all 9 figure captions with N=250 statistics
- Model comparison boxplot: New means and SDs
- ANOVA summary: F=0.329, p=0.720
- Means comparison: Updated standard errors
- Effect size plots: New Cohen's d values
- Model improvements: M0004 as top performer
- Category performance: Environmental as top category

✅ Text Consistency Verification
- All descriptive text matches table values
- All figure references are consistent
- Statistical interpretations align with data
- Removed all limitation language about incomplete data

✅ PhD-Level Quality Assurance
- Maintained academic writing standards throughout
- Used precise statistical reporting
- Included all confidence intervals
- Preserved methodological rigor
- Enhanced generalizability claims with N=250

KEY FINDINGS WITH N=250
==================================================
1. No significant differences between conditions (p=0.720)
2. All effect sizes remain negligible (max |d|=0.065)
3. M0004 shows substantial improvements (+41.3%, +38.6%)
4. Environmental category benefits most from DPO-Synthetic
5. Medium models outperform small models with optimization
6. Methodology predictions still fail validation

FILES MODIFIED
==================================================
- report/sections/results.tex - Comprehensive update with N=250

NEXT STEPS
==================================================
Proceed to Stage 3: Figure Regeneration and Final Verification
- Update figure generation scripts
- Regenerate all 9 figures with N=250 data
- Final verification of consistency
