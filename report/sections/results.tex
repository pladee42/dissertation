\section{Agent Model Selection Validation}
\label{sec:agent-model-validation}

Systematic comparison studies were conducted to evaluate the performance of traditional language models versus reasoning-capable models for checklist generation and evaluation tasks. For the Checklist Creator Agent, comparative analysis between GPT-4.1-nano (representing traditional high-performance models) and DeepSeek R1 (representing reasoning-specialized architectures) demonstrated significant advantages in evaluation criteria quality and consistency for the reasoning-capable model.

Similarly, for the Judge Agent, empirical comparison between Gemini-2.5 Flash (representing efficient traditional models) and GPT O3 Mini (representing reasoning-optimized models) revealed superior performance in evaluation consistency, scoring reliability, and analytical depth for the reasoning-capable architecture. These preliminary studies established the empirical foundation for agent-specific model selection based on task-appropriate capabilities rather than general performance metrics.
