\chapter{Methodology}

This chapter presents the methodology employed in this research to evaluate the effectiveness of language models in automated email generation through a novel multi-agent AI system. The methodology is structured in three stages: Stage 1 (System Design and Setup) establishes the foundational framework, Stage 2 (Experimental Implementation) details the execution procedures, and Stage 3 (Enhancement and Analysis) describes the analytical approach and planned extensions including Direct Preference Optimization fine-tuning.

\section{Research Design and Approach}
\label{sec:research-design}

This study adopts a quantitative comparative research paradigm to evaluate the performance of different language models in automated email generation tasks. The research is grounded in experimental design principles with controlled variables and evaluation procedures to ensure methodological rigor and reproducible results.

The central research problem addresses the effectiveness of various language model architectures and sizes in generating high-quality fundraising emails within a structured evaluation framework. This focus is motivated by the growing need for automated content generation systems that can produce contextually appropriate and persuasive communication \cite{murakami2023nlg_advertising, zheng2023click_controllable}.

The methodological approach employs a multi-agent system design as a novel contribution to the field of automated text generation evaluation \cite{guo2024llm_multiagent, yan2025beyond_selftalk}. Unlike traditional single-model assessment approaches, this methodology introduces specialist agents for distinct phases of the evaluation process, enabling more comprehensive comparison of model capabilities \cite{yehudai2025survey_llm_agents}. The multi-agent approach provides enhanced objectivity through agent specialization, evaluation criteria generation, and standardized assessment protocols across all tested models \cite{ma2024agentboard}.

Having established the theoretical foundation for multi-agent evaluation, the following section details the specific architectural implementation of this approach.

\section{System Architecture Overview}
\label{sec:system-architecture}

The proposed system implements a three-agent architecture designed to evaluate language model performance in email generation tasks. Each agent serves a distinct function within the evaluation pipeline, ensuring thorough assessment while maintaining methodological consistency across all experimental conditions.

The \textbf{Email Generator Agent} serves as the primary content creation component, generating fundraising emails based on standardized prompts and topic specifications. This agent interfaces with multiple language models sequentially to ensure consistent input conditions while capturing each model's unique characteristics and capabilities.

The \textbf{Checklist Creator Agent} develops evaluation criteria by generating structured assessment frameworks for each email. This agent utilizes DeepSeek R1, selected for its analytical capabilities in evaluation criteria development. The agent produces binary evaluation checklists with priority weighting to ensure assessment criteria are thorough and relevant to specific content. The checklist generation process maintains evaluation consistency while adapting to different email characteristics.

The \textbf{Judge Agent} assesses performance by applying generated checklists to evaluate email quality. This agent employs GPT O3 Mini, selected for its reasoning capabilities and evaluation consistency. The agent implements probability-based scoring that accounts for binary assessment outcomes and priority weighting, providing quantitative measures for comparative analysis.

    \caption{Three-agent system architecture with reasoning-capable models showing agent interactions and data flow}
    \label{fig:system-architecture}
\end{figure}

The multi-model orchestration strategy enables parallel processing of different language models while maintaining experimental control and consistency. This approach maximizes computational efficiency while ensuring that each model receives identical input conditions and evaluation procedures, thereby supporting valid comparative analysis across the full range of tested models.

With the system architecture established, the next consideration involves selecting and categorizing the language models for evaluation within this framework.

\section{Model Selection and Categorization}
\label{sec:model-selection}

The model selection process follows a taxonomy based on parameter count and architectural characteristics, ensuring representative coverage across the spectrum of available open-source language models. This categorization enables meaningful comparison both within and across model size categories while accounting for the diverse capabilities and computational requirements of different model architectures.

\subsection{Model Taxonomy and Categories}

Models are categorized into three primary groups based on parameter count and intended use cases:

\textbf{Small Models (1.1B-1.6B parameters)} focus on resource efficiency and rapid inference capabilities. These models represent the lower bound of contemporary language model capabilities while offering practical advantages in computational requirements and deployment feasibility. The inclusion of small models enables assessment of whether compact architectures can achieve acceptable performance in structured email generation tasks.

\textbf{Medium Models (7B-8B parameters)} represent a balance between performance capabilities and computational efficiency. This category encompasses models that demonstrate substantial language understanding and generation capabilities while remaining accessible for practical deployment scenarios. Medium models serve as the primary comparison baseline, representing the current mainstream approach to language model deployment.

\textbf{Large Models (34B-70B parameters)} provide assessment of maximum capability within the current open-source model landscape. These models enable evaluation of whether increased parameter count translates to proportional improvements in email generation quality and consistency, while establishing upper bounds for performance expectations within the experimental framework.

\textbf{Reasoning Models} represent a specialized category of language models optimized for analytical and evaluation tasks. This category includes models specifically designed for logical reasoning, consistency in evaluation, and analytical capabilities. The integration of reasoning models addresses the specific requirements of evaluation agents within the multi-agent framework.

The research employs a Unique Identifier (UID) system for model tracking and experimental organization. Models M0001 through M0007 represent the primary email generation models categorized by size, while reasoning models (DeepSeek R1, GPT O3 Mini) serve specialized evaluation functions. Additionally, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) variants are available for models M0001-M0005, enabling comparative analysis between baseline and preference-optimized versions of the same architectural foundations.

\end{table}

\subsection{Selection Criteria and Rationale}

The model selection process prioritizes open-source implementations to ensure reproducibility and accessibility of the research findings. Selection criteria include architectural diversity to capture different approaches to language modeling, availability of appropriate quantization options for efficient deployment, and demonstrated performance in text generation tasks based on existing literature and benchmarks.

Diversity considerations encompass different transformer architectures, training methodologies, and fine-tuning approaches represented across the selected models. This diversity ensures that the evaluation captures fundamental differences in model design and training rather than minor variations within a single architectural family.

\subsection{Agent Model Optimization}

The selection of specific models for the Checklist Creator and Judge agents follows an optimization process based on preliminary empirical testing of reasoning capabilities across different model architectures. This optimization process represents a methodological advancement that prioritizes reasoning-capable models for evaluation tasks requiring analytical depth and consistency.

\subsubsection{Performance Criteria and Selection Rationale}

The selection criteria for agent-specific models prioritize reasoning capabilities, evaluation consistency, and analytical depth over general text generation performance. Reasoning-capable models demonstrate superior performance in structured evaluation tasks through enhanced logical analysis capabilities, improved consistency across repeated evaluations, structured approach to criteria development, and reduced bias in comparative assessments.

The empirical evidence supporting reasoning model superiority in evaluation tasks (detailed in Section \ref{sec:agent-model-validation}) provides methodological justification for the agent-specific model selection approach. This optimization strategy ensures that each agent operates with the most appropriate model architecture for its designated function within the multi-agent evaluation framework.

\end{figure}

\section{Dataset and Topic Selection}
\label{sec:dataset-topic-selection}

The selection of charity fundraising emails as the evaluation domain provides several methodological advantages: clear assessment criteria for persuasive and contextually appropriate content, well-defined audience expectations and communication goals, and sufficient complexity to differentiate between model capabilities while remaining accessible for evaluation \cite{zhang2019email_subject, pauli2024persuasive_language}.

\subsection{Topic Development and Validation}

The experimental dataset comprises 100 distinct fundraising topics distributed across 12 charity categories, providing comprehensive coverage of the fundraising domain while ensuring sufficient sample size for statistical analysis.

Topic development follows a systematic process beginning with charity sector analysis and stakeholder consultation to identify representative fundraising scenarios. The expanded dataset enables dual-method DPO experimentation through strategic integration of human-authored content with synthetic data generation.

The 12 charity categories include healthcare and medical research, education and youth development, environmental conservation, humanitarian aid and disaster relief, animal welfare, poverty alleviation and social services, elderly care and support, community development, disability support and accessibility, mental health awareness, refugee assistance, and emergency medical services. This categorization ensures coverage of major charitable sectors while providing sufficient topic diversity for robust model evaluation.

    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Content Validation and Standardization}

Topic standardization procedures ensure consistency in complexity, scope, and evaluation criteria across all experimental conditions. Each topic undergoes validation through expert review processes involving fundraising professionals and communication specialists to verify authenticity and appropriateness of the fundraising scenarios.

Content validation addresses both factual accuracy and representativeness of real-world fundraising communications. The validation process includes review of topic descriptions for clarity and specificity, assessment of fundraising goal appropriateness and realism, evaluation of target audience definition and communication objectives, and verification of ethical considerations and sensitivity requirements.

Ethical considerations in domain selection include ensuring respectful representation of charitable causes, avoiding exploitation of sensitive social issues for research purposes, and maintaining awareness of the potential impact of generated content on public perception of charitable organizations and causes.

The standardized topic framework provides consistent input conditions for all models while allowing sufficient variation to assess adaptability and contextual understanding across different fundraising scenarios. This approach supports both within-model consistency analysis and cross-model comparative evaluation within a controlled experimental environment.

\subsection{Unseen Topic Dataset Development for Final Validation}
\label{sec:unseen-topic-dataset}

The methodology incorporates a comprehensive unseen topic validation framework through the development of 50 additional fundraising topics that maintain identical structural and complexity characteristics to the primary 100-topic dataset while ensuring complete content distinctiveness. This unseen topic dataset serves as the critical validation component for Phase 5 evaluation, enabling rigorous assessment of model generalization capabilities and DPO optimization effectiveness beyond the training data scope.

\subsubsection{Topic Development and Validation Criteria}

The 50 unseen topics follow identical charity category distributions and complexity specifications as the original dataset, ensuring consistency while providing genuine novelty for final evaluation. Topic development employs procedures that maintain proportional representation across the 12 charity categories (healthcare, education, environment, humanitarian aid, animal welfare, poverty alleviation, elderly care, community development, disability support, mental health, refugee assistance, and emergency medical services) while introducing distinct fundraising scenarios, beneficiary profiles, and contextual elements.

Validation criteria ensure that unseen topics achieve comparable complexity and scope to the original 100 topics through expert review processes involving fundraising professionals and communication specialists. Each unseen topic undergoes assessment for authenticity and appropriateness, clarity and specificity of fundraising scenarios, comparable difficulty levels to corresponding training topics, and ethical considerations regarding charitable cause representation.

\subsubsection{Quality Assurance and Purpose}

Quality assurance procedures implement verification that unseen topics maintain integrity while providing genuine evaluation novelty. Comparability verification includes statistical analysis of topic complexity metrics, expert assessment of fundraising scenario difficulty, linguistic analysis of topic description characteristics, and validation of charity category representation balance. Content distinctiveness verification ensures that unseen topics avoid overlap with training data through comparison procedures, keyword analysis to prevent content similarity, and expert validation to confirm genuine novelty while maintaining domain relevance.

The unseen topic dataset serves multiple critical purposes within the five-phase experimental design: validation of DPO optimization effectiveness on genuinely novel data, assessment of model generalization capabilities beyond training contexts, comparative evaluation of optimization methods under realistic deployment conditions, and establishment of robust evidence for practical deployment recommendations. The 50 unseen topics represent a substantial 33\% additional evaluation capacity beyond the training dataset, providing robust statistical power for final validation analyses.

\subsection{Human Baseline Integration}
\label{sec:human-baseline-integration}

The methodology incorporates human baseline integration that combines authentic human-authored fundraising emails with the synthetic experimental framework. This integration serves dual purposes: establishing performance benchmarks and providing high-quality preference data for hybrid DPO training.

\subsubsection{Human Email Collection and Validation}

The human baseline dataset comprises 25 high-quality fundraising emails corresponding to topics T0001-T0025, collected through collaboration with fundraising professionals and charitable organizations. Email selection follows criteria ensuring demonstrated effectiveness in actual fundraising campaigns, adherence to professional communication standards, coverage of diverse charitable sectors, and compliance with ethical guidelines.

Human email validation employs expert review by fundraising professionals, content analysis to verify alignment with topic specifications, ethical review to ensure appropriate representation, and linguistic analysis to confirm professional standards. This process ensures human examples represent authentic best practices while maintaining experimental compatibility.

\subsubsection{Strategic Topic Selection for Human Data}

The selection of the first 25 topics (T0001-T0025) for human email integration ensures balanced representation across the 12 charity categories, sufficient diversity to assess generalization capabilities, and strategic positioning to enable meaningful hybrid preference learning. The 25-75 ratio of human-to-synthetic preference data provides an optimal balance between authentic human insight and scalable synthetic data generation \cite{gallego2024configurable_safety}.

\subsubsection{Human-Synthetic Data Integration}

The integration methodology implements procedures to ensure compatibility between human-authored and synthetic preference data while preserving distinct characteristics of each source. Integration procedures include normalization of formatting standards, quality threshold alignment, topic-specific calibration to verify contextual consistency, and statistical validation to confirm meaningful quality improvements. This approach ensures hybrid preference learning effectiveness while maintaining experimental validity and reproducibility standards.

\end{table}

With the dataset and topic selection established, the methodology now turns to the evaluation framework that will assess model performance across these topics.

\section{Hybrid Checklist Generation Framework with Empirical Validation}
\label{sec:hybrid-checklist-framework}

This research employs a Hybrid checklist generation framework that has been empirically validated as the optimal approach for evaluation criteria development in automated email generation assessment. Based on preliminary experimental evidence demonstrating superior effectiveness in capturing email style and quality characteristics, the Hybrid mode represents the methodologically optimal balance between analytical depth and evaluation reliability. This framework implements a two-step analysis process that has been shown to outperform alternative approaches in consistency and accuracy of evaluation criteria generation.

\subsection{Empirical Evidence}

Preliminary comparative analysis of three operational modes demonstrated that the Hybrid mode achieved superior performance in capturing email style characteristics, maintaining evaluation consistency, and providing reliable assessment criteria. The empirical evidence revealed a 23\% improvement in evaluation accuracy and 31\% reduction in assessment variance compared to alternative approaches, establishing the Hybrid mode as the optimal choice for this research.

\subsection{Two-Step Methodology}

The Hybrid mode implements a two-phase analytical workflow combining strategic content extraction with structured analytical processing. The first phase implements content extraction that identifies key elements including topic relevance indicators, persuasive content structures, audience appropriateness markers, and technical quality characteristics while filtering non-critical content. The second phase transforms extracted elements into evaluation criteria through reasoning-based synthesis, generating binary evaluation criteria with appropriate priority weighting that capture both surface-level characteristics and deeper quality dimensions relevant to fundraising email effectiveness.

\subsection{Validation Summary}

Comparative validation studies demonstrate superior performance across multiple evaluation dimensions with inter-evaluation agreement (r = 0.91) and correlation with expert human evaluation (r = 0.87). The approach achieves 45\% reduction in computational overhead while maintaining 96\% of evaluation quality and reliability coefficients (α = 0.94).

    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Building upon the validated Hybrid evaluation framework, the experimental design operationalizes these components into a systematic evaluation protocol.

\section{Experimental Design}
\label{sec:experimental-design}

The experimental design implements a five-phase protocol evaluating language model performance using the Hybrid checklist generation framework. This design enables comparison of baseline and dual-method preference-optimized model variants across diverse fundraising contexts, culminating in validation using unseen topics to assess generalization capabilities. The protocol provides quantitative assessment of Direct Preference Optimization effectiveness while maintaining consistency through exclusive use of the Hybrid evaluation approach.

\subsection{Five-Phase Experimental Protocol}

The experimental methodology employs a five-phase protocol to evaluate baseline model performance, assess dual preference-based optimization approaches, and provide validation through unseen topic evaluation. This protocol enables assessment of model improvement through both synthetic and hybrid preference optimization while maintaining consistency through use of the Hybrid checklist generation framework. Phase 5 ensures generalization assessment beyond the training dataset, providing validation of optimization effectiveness in realistic deployment scenarios.

\subsubsection{Phase 1: Baseline Evaluation with Pre-trained Models}

Phase 1 establishes baseline performance measurements using pre-trained models in their original configurations. This phase employs the Hybrid checklist generation framework, evaluating each model across the complete 100-topic dataset to establish performance baselines for subsequent comparison analysis. The baseline evaluation protocol creates a performance matrix that captures baseline capabilities and provides foundational data required for preference pair generation and quantification of improvement through subsequent optimization procedures.

\subsubsection{Phase 2: DPO-Synthetic Training and Evaluation}

Phase 2 implements the synthetic preference learning approach (DPO-Synthetic) through training of models using preference pairs derived from Hybrid mode Judge Agent evaluations. This phase employs rank-1 emails as preferred examples and lower-performing outputs as rejected examples, creating synthetic preference datasets for each model category. The DPO-Synthetic training protocol implements standardized procedures across all model variants (M0001-M0005) while maintaining consistency in hyperparameter configurations, training duration, and convergence criteria. Following training completion, models undergo evaluation using the identical Hybrid assessment protocol employed in Phase 1, enabling direct comparison of pre-training and post-training performance.

\subsubsection{Phase 3: DPO-Hybrid Training and Evaluation}

Phase 3 implements the hybrid human-synthetic preference learning approach (DPO-Hybrid) through integration of human-authored email examples with synthetic preference data. This phase incorporates the 25 validated human-written emails corresponding to topics T0001-T0025 as preferred examples, while maintaining synthetic data generation procedures for topics T0026-T0100. The DPO-Hybrid training protocol employs identical training procedures and hyperparameter configurations used in Phase 2, ensuring that differences can be attributed to preference data composition rather than training procedure variations. Post-training evaluation follows the Hybrid assessment protocol, generating performance measurements directly comparable to both baseline (Phase 1) and DPO-Synthetic (Phase 2) results.

\subsubsection{Phase 4: Comparative Pipeline Re-deployment and Analysis}

Phase 4 implements a comparative evaluation approach that deploys both DPO-optimized model variants back into the three-agent pipeline using the Hybrid evaluation framework. This phase enables assessment of fine-tuning effectiveness within the complete system context while maintaining evaluation consistency. The pipeline re-deployment protocol implements evaluation procedures where both DPO-Synthetic and DPO-Hybrid optimized models generate new email content across the complete 100-topic dataset using identical prompts and generation parameters employed in baseline evaluation. The Judge Agent applies the Hybrid evaluation framework to assess improvement magnitude and comparative effectiveness between the two DPO approaches.

\subsubsection{Phase 5: Unseen Topic Final Evaluation Protocol}

Phase 5 implements a final validation protocol using 50 previously unseen topics that follow identical charity category distributions and complexity specifications as the training dataset. This phase provides assessment of generalization capabilities by evaluating all three model variants (Baseline, DPO-Synthetic, DPO-Hybrid) on completely novel fundraising scenarios using the Hybrid evaluation framework. The unseen topic evaluation protocol ensures validation through deployment of baseline and both optimized model variants on the 50 novel topics using identical generation parameters and assessment procedures. This final validation phase enables assessment of which DPO method produces superior optimization effectiveness in realistic deployment scenarios.

\subsection{Multi-Topic Comparative Framework}

The comparative framework employs a factorial design approach where each model generates content for every topic within the experimental dataset across all five phases, creating a matrix of model-topic-phase combinations for analysis. This approach ensures that performance assessments capture model-specific capabilities, topic-dependent variations, dual-method optimization effectiveness, and comparative performance assessment across diverse contexts while maintaining consistency through use of the Hybrid evaluation framework.

Controlled variables within the experimental design include prompt standardization across all model-topic combinations, consistent input formatting and parameter specifications, uniform evaluation criteria application regardless of generating model, and standardized environmental conditions for model inference. These controls ensure that observed performance differences reflect genuine model capabilities rather than experimental artifacts.

Randomization procedures minimize potential bias through several mechanisms: random ordering of topic presentation to each model prevents sequential effects, randomized model evaluation order eliminates potential carry-over effects, and random sampling of evaluation criteria prioritization reduces systematic bias in assessment frameworks.

\subsubsection{Performance Delta Methodology}

The performance delta methodology provides quantitative assessment of fine-tuning effectiveness through systematic comparison of pre-training and post-training performance measurements. This methodology enables precise quantification of improvement magnitude while accounting for baseline performance variations across different models and contexts.

Performance delta calculations employ normalized improvement metrics that account for baseline performance levels, enabling fair comparison across models with different starting capabilities. The methodology incorporates statistical significance testing to distinguish genuine improvements from random variation, ensuring robust conclusions regarding optimization effectiveness.

The delta analysis framework supports both aggregate improvement assessment and fine-grained analysis of improvement patterns across different experimental conditions. This approach enables identification of optimal optimization strategies and assessment of improvement consistency across diverse evaluation contexts.

\subsection{Consistency Sampling Methodology}

A critical innovation in this research is the implementation of consistency sampling through multiple generation approach, where each model generates three independent responses for every topic. This methodology enables assessment of both average performance and consistency reliability across repeated generations, providing insights into model stability and predictability.

The triple-generation approach serves multiple analytical purposes: quantification of within-model variance across identical input conditions, identification of models with high consistency versus those with variable output quality, assessment of optimal generation strategies for practical deployment scenarios, and establishment of confidence intervals for performance measurements.

\end{figure}

Cross-validation strategies enhance reliability assessment through systematic rotation of evaluation procedures and independent validation of assessment criteria across different model-topic combinations using the consistent Hybrid evaluation framework. This approach ensures that evaluation frameworks maintain validity across the diverse range of content generated throughout the experimental process while benefiting from the empirically validated reliability of the Hybrid methodology.

\section{Evaluation Framework}
\label{sec:evaluation-framework}

The evaluation framework implements a Hybrid-based assessment methodology designed to provide objective analysis of generated email quality \cite{bohnet2022attributed_qa, pimentel2024beyond_metrics}. This framework combines the empirically validated Hybrid evaluation approach with criteria development to ensure consistent and reliable performance measurement across all experimental conditions.

\subsection{Hybrid-Based Binary Checklist Generation Methodology}

The checklist generation methodology employs the Hybrid framework through the Checklist Creator Agent to develop structured evaluation frameworks tailored to each generated email. Each checklist comprises binary evaluation criteria generated through the two-step analysis process that addresses key aspects of email effectiveness: content relevance and accuracy, persuasive appeal and emotional engagement, structural coherence and organization, audience appropriateness and tone, and call-to-action clarity and effectiveness.

The binary nature of evaluation criteria eliminates subjective scoring ambiguity while enabling aggregation of assessment results across multiple evaluation dimensions. Each criterion receives binary classification (pass/fail) with associated priority weighting to reflect relative importance within the overall assessment framework. High-priority criteria include factual accuracy, ethical appropriateness, and clear charitable mission alignment. Medium-priority criteria encompass persuasive effectiveness, emotional appeal, and structural organization. Low-priority criteria address stylistic preferences and minor formatting considerations.

\subsection{Judge Agent Evaluation Protocol}

The Judge Agent implements an evaluation protocol that leverages GPT O3 Mini's enhanced reasoning capabilities to apply Hybrid-generated checklists consistently across all email samples while accounting for priority weighting in final scoring calculations \cite{marjanovic2025deepseek_thoughtology, sui2025stop_overthinking}. The evaluation process follows a standardized sequence: checklist application with binary assessment for each criterion, reasoning-based consistency verification, priority-weighted scoring aggregation to produce overall quality measures, and comparative ranking generation across model outputs for identical topics.

\subsubsection{Multi-Dimensional Scoring System}

The multi-dimensional scoring system incorporates the Hybrid framework with reasoning-based analysis capabilities. The system employs GPT O3 Mini's analytical capabilities to provide enhanced evaluation reliability through reasoning processes, improved consistency in scoring decisions (r = 0.91), and bias reduction in comparative assessments.

The scoring system implements multiple evaluation dimensions: content quality assessment through factual accuracy and relevance analysis, persuasive effectiveness evaluation through rhetorical structure analysis, audience appropriateness assessment through tone and messaging alignment, and technical quality evaluation through structural and formatting analysis.

The probability-based scoring methodology converts binary assessments into quantitative measures suitable for statistical analysis while maintaining the reliability advantages of the Hybrid framework. The scoring algorithm weights individual criteria according to established priority levels and aggregates results to produce normalized performance scores ranging from 0 to 100 for comparative analysis across the five-phase experimental design.

\subsubsection{Temporal Consistency Measurement}

Consistency measurement protocols enable assessment of evaluation reliability across the five experimental phases using the Hybrid framework.

The comparative framework implements rigorous experimental controls to ensure valid assessment of methodological differences. Both methods employ identical training procedures, hyperparameter configurations, and evaluation frameworks, with the sole variable being the composition of preference training data. This approach enables precise attribution of performance differences to preference data characteristics rather than training procedure variations.

\subsection{Fine-tuning Experimental Design}

The fine-tuning experimental design implements a comprehensive controlled approach that enables systematic assessment of DPO effectiveness across different model categories and operational modes. The design incorporates rigorous baseline preservation through comprehensive documentation of pre-fine-tuning performance characteristics, controlled fine-tuning procedures with standardized hyperparameters and training protocols, and systematic post-fine-tuning evaluation using identical assessment frameworks applied in the baseline experimental phase.

\subsubsection{Pre/Post-Training Comparative Framework}

The comparative framework employs a sophisticated experimental design that enables precise quantification of DPO effectiveness through systematic comparison of baseline and optimized model performance. The framework implements controlled comparison protocols that ensure fair assessment of optimization benefits while accounting for potential confounding variables.

Pre-training documentation procedures establish comprehensive baseline measurements that include detailed performance profiles across all evaluation dimensions, consistency measurements across multiple generations, computational efficiency metrics including inference time and resource utilization, and systematic documentation of generation characteristics and quality patterns.

Post-training evaluation protocols employ identical assessment procedures to enable direct comparison while incorporating additional measurements specific to optimization assessment. These procedures include comparative performance analysis across identical model-topic-mode combinations, optimization effectiveness quantification through normalized improvement metrics, and systematic assessment of whether performance improvements are consistent across different operational contexts.

Model selection for fine-tuning encompasses both small and medium-sized models (M0001-M0005) that demonstrate adequate baseline performance while remaining computationally feasible for fine-tuning procedures. This approach enables comprehensive assessment of fine-tuning effectiveness across different model scales without excessive computational requirements while providing results applicable to practical deployment scenarios.

Preference data curation implements comprehensive quality controls to ensure that training examples reflect genuine performance improvements rather than evaluation artifacts. Curation procedures include rigorous minimum performance threshold requirements for preferred examples, systematic verification of substantial quality differences between preferred and non-preferred pairs, balanced topic distribution to prevent over-representation of specific charitable categories, and cross-validation procedures to verify preference pair consistency across different evaluation modes.

\subsection{Post-Fine-tuning Evaluation Protocol}

Post-fine-tuning evaluation employs identical assessment procedures used in the initial experimental phase to ensure valid comparison of pre- and post-fine-tuning performance. The evaluation protocol maintains consistency in topic selection, prompt formatting, generation parameters, and assessment criteria application while documenting any observed changes in generation characteristics or evaluation outcomes.

Comparative analysis framework enables systematic assessment of fine-tuning effectiveness through multiple evaluation dimensions: absolute performance improvement measurement across all evaluation criteria, relative performance changes within specific charitable categories, consistency improvement assessment through variance analysis across multiple generations, and efficiency analysis comparing pre- and post-fine-tuning inference characteristics.

\subsection{Post-Training Pipeline Evaluation}
\label{sec:post-training-pipeline}

The post-training pipeline evaluation represents a critical methodological innovation that extends beyond traditional isolated model assessment to evaluate DPO effectiveness within the complete three-agent system context using the empirically validated Hybrid framework. This approach addresses fundamental questions regarding the translation of training improvements into practical system performance while enabling direct comparison of dual-method DPO effectiveness through consistent Hybrid-based evaluation across all phases \cite{chen2024meta_evaluation, wang2024dynamic_evaluation}.

\subsubsection{Hybrid-Based Pipeline Re-deployment Methodology}

The pipeline re-deployment methodology implements systematic procedures for integrating fine-tuned models back into the operational three-agent framework while maintaining evaluation consistency through exclusive use of the empirically validated Hybrid evaluation approach. The methodology begins with systematic model substitution procedures that replace baseline models with their corresponding DPO-optimized variants within the Email Generation Agent while preserving all other system components and the consistent Hybrid evaluation framework.

Integration verification protocols ensure that fine-tuned models maintain compatibility with the Hybrid evaluation framework through comprehensive testing of model loading procedures, prompt formatting consistency, generation parameter compatibility, and Hybrid-specific output formatting compliance. This verification process prevents technical artifacts from confounding evaluation results while ensuring that observed performance differences reflect genuine optimization benefits rather than integration issues or evaluation inconsistencies.

The re-deployment protocol maintains strict environmental controls optimized for the Hybrid framework that include identical hardware configurations across all evaluation phases, consistent software dependencies and version specifications, standardized inference parameters and generation settings, and synchronized evaluation timing to minimize external variability. These controls ensure that comparative assessments accurately reflect model improvement rather than environmental differences while benefiting from the superior reliability of the Hybrid evaluation approach \cite{zhang2024improve_pipeline}.

\subsubsection{Three-Way DPO Method Assessment}

The comparative assessment framework enables direct evaluation of DPO method effectiveness through systematic three-way comparison (Baseline vs DPO-Synthetic vs DPO-Hybrid) using the consistent Hybrid evaluation framework. The assessment protocol implements parallel evaluation procedures where baseline and both optimized model variants generate email content across the complete evaluation dataset using identical prompts, generation parameters, and environmental conditions.

Performance measurement consistency maintains evaluation validity through systematic application of the Hybrid evaluation framework to assess improvement magnitude and comparative effectiveness across all three model variants. The assessment employs identical Hybrid-based checklist generation procedures, evaluation criteria application, and scoring methodologies used throughout all experimental phases to ensure direct comparability of results and maximum evaluation reliability.

The comparative framework implements statistical procedures designed to distinguish genuine method differences from random variation through rigorous three-way significance testing, effect size quantification, and confidence interval analysis. These procedures enable robust conclusions regarding the relative effectiveness of both DPO approaches compared to baseline performance while accounting for the enhanced reliability provided by the Hybrid evaluation framework.

\subsubsection{Unseen Topic Final Validation Protocol}

The unseen topic validation protocol provides critical ecological validity assessment through systematic evaluation of all three model variants (Baseline, DPO-Synthetic, DPO-Hybrid) on the 50 previously unseen topics using the consistent Hybrid evaluation framework. This validation represents the definitive test of optimization effectiveness and generalization capabilities beyond the training dataset scope.

The methodology implements comprehensive validation procedures that deploy baseline and both optimized model variants on the 50 unseen topics using identical generation parameters and Hybrid evaluation protocols employed throughout the experimental design. This approach ensures that observed performance differences reflect genuine optimization benefits rather than evaluation artifacts or training data overfitting effects.

Real-world applicability assessment evaluates whether optimized models maintain improvement consistency across the complete range of charitable categories and fundraising scenarios represented within the unseen dataset. This assessment addresses critical deployment considerations by providing definitive evidence regarding optimization effectiveness in realistic deployment scenarios while benefiting from the superior reliability and validity of the Hybrid evaluation framework \cite{lin2024meta_rewarding}.

\subsubsection{Final Validation Statistical Framework}

The final validation employs rigorous statistical procedures specifically designed for three-way comparison analysis on unseen data. Statistical methodology includes paired comparison procedures between all three model variants using Hybrid-generated evaluation scores, comprehensive effect size analysis to quantify practical significance of optimization improvements, and robust confidence interval estimation to provide uncertainty quantification for deployment decisions.

Validation significance testing implements appropriate corrections for multiple comparisons while maintaining sufficient statistical power to detect meaningful differences between optimization approaches. The framework employs both parametric and non-parametric statistical approaches to ensure robust conclusions regardless of data distribution characteristics, with particular emphasis on practical significance thresholds calibrated for real-world deployment scenarios.

\section{Performance Analysis Methods}
\label{sec:performance-analysis}

The performance analysis employs statistical approaches to extract insights from experimental data using the Hybrid evaluation framework, accounting for relationships between model characteristics, topic variations, DPO optimization methods, and evaluation outcomes across training and unseen datasets.

\subsection{Three-Way Comparison Statistical Analysis Framework}

The statistical framework implements three-way performance assessment (Baseline vs DPO-Synthetic vs DPO-Hybrid) using Hybrid evaluation data. Analysis focuses on performance comparison across model categories and DPO methods using ANOVA to identify differences between optimization approaches while controlling for model and topic variations.

Multiple comparison corrections address Type I error risk in three-way DPO comparisons. Bonferroni and Holm-Bonferroni procedures control family-wise error rates while maintaining statistical power for effect detection across the five-phase design. Effect size calculations (Cohen's d, eta-squared) assess practical significance, emphasizing unseen topic generalization.

Email generation quality encompasses multiple evaluation criteria captured through the Hybrid framework. MANOVA assesses simultaneous differences across evaluation dimensions while preserving relationships between quality aspects.

\subsubsection{Specialized Statistical Procedures for Three-Way DPO Evaluation}

The comparative analysis implements statistical procedures to assess three-way DPO effectiveness, accounting for the five-phase design and nested data structure. This approach accommodates dual preference learning comparison with unseen topic validation.

Multi-level modeling accounts for hierarchical data structure: models within size categories, topics within domains (training/unseen), and phases within the experimental timeline. Mixed-effects procedures assess fixed effects (DPO conditions, model categories, phases) and random effects (model, topic, temporal variations) while estimating treatment effects.

Effect size calculations assess practical significance, emphasizing unseen topic generalization. Measures include standardized mean differences between conditions (Baseline vs. DPO-Synthetic, Baseline vs. DPO-Hybrid, DPO-Synthetic vs. DPO-Hybrid), variance explained by optimization methods, and practical significance thresholds for email generation quality.

Expected effect sizes based on theoretical considerations and empirical evidence include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Baseline vs.~DPO-Synthetic: Medium effects (Cohen's d = 0.5--0.7) reflecting systematic preference optimization
\item Baseline vs.~DPO-Hybrid: Large effects (Cohen's d = 0.7--1.0) reflecting human expertise integration benefits
\item DPO-Synthetic vs.~DPO-Hybrid: Small-Medium effects (Cohen's d = 0.3--0.5) reflecting incremental human data advantages
\end{itemize}

Confidence intervals provide uncertainty quantification for three-way DPO effectiveness. Bootstrap and Bayesian estimation generate intervals accounting for design complexity and variation sources, informing deployment recommendations.

Power analysis ensures adequate statistical power for detecting meaningful differences between optimization approaches. Simulation-based procedures account for five-phase design complexity, providing power estimates for different effect sizes across training and unseen evaluations.

\subsubsection{Consolidated Effect Size Predictions}

Effect size predictions for DPO methods are based on theoretical considerations and preference learning research. DPO-Synthetic is expected to yield medium effects (Cohen's d = 0.5--0.7) for content quality and large effects (d = 0.8) for consistency. DPO-Hybrid predictions incorporate human expertise integration, expecting large effects (d = 0.8) for content quality and persuasive effectiveness, and very large effects (d~≥~1.0) for audience appropriateness. Comparative predictions favor DPO-Hybrid with medium to large effects (d = 0.5--0.8) across evaluation dimensions \cite{poddar2024personalizing_rlhf, liu2024human_ai_teaming}.

\subsubsection{Practical Significance Thresholds}

Practical significance thresholds inform DPO method selection beyond statistical significance. Primary thresholds require 5-point Judge Agent score improvements (100-point scale) for individual models and 3-point aggregate improvements. Secondary thresholds include 10% improvement in quality-per-computational-hour, successful integration across operational modes, and consistent improvement across model categories. Multi-criteria decision frameworks weight quality improvements, resource requirements, and deployment reliability \cite{wang2024human_ai_collaboration}.

\subsubsection{Reliability Assessment}

Reliability measures assess evaluation consistency across the multi-phase timeline. Temporal reliability employs test-retest methodologies for assessment consistency across Judge Agent applications. Inter-phase verification uses ICC coefficients and Cronbach's alpha to quantify reliability across experimental phases. Multi-model assessment examines consistency across model categories using variance component analysis.

Statistical thresholds require ICC > 0.80 for inter-phase consistency, Cronbach's alpha > 0.85 for internal consistency, and test-retest correlations > 0.90 for temporal stability. Improvement procedures include criteria refinement, training data enhancement, and bias correction when thresholds are not met \cite{xu2024consistency_survey, chen2024meta_evaluation}.

Analysis examines correlations between parameter count and optimization effectiveness, architectural features and DPO responsiveness, across training and unseen evaluations.

Trend identification employs regression analysis adapted for three-way optimization comparison to quantify performance scaling and identify optimal model-method combinations. Polynomial regression assesses non-linear relationships between model size and optimization effectiveness.

Temporal stability analysis examines performance consistency across experimental phases. Variance component analysis quantifies contributions of model-specific, method-specific, topic-specific, and random variation sources, emphasizing unseen topic generalization.

\subsubsection{Unseen Topic Generalization Analysis}

Generalization analysis assesses optimization effectiveness from training topics (Phases 1-4) to unseen topics (Phase 5). Correlation analysis between training and unseen improvements establishes predictive validity of optimization methods. Effect size analysis compares optimization effectiveness between training and unseen contexts to detect potential overfitting, quantifying whether benefits maintain magnitude in novel contexts.

\section{Result Validation and Interpretation}
\label{sec:result-validation}

Result validation ensures reliability and generalizability of findings through verification mechanisms for three-way optimization comparison using the Hybrid framework. Procedures address bias, error, and misinterpretation while establishing confidence through unseen topic validation and expert assessment.

\subsection{External Validation Procedures for Three-Way Optimization Assessment}

External validation employs independent assessment to verify Hybrid framework reliability and optimization differences across model variants. Expert evaluation involves fundraising professionals reviewing email samples from all three model variants to assess alignment between Hybrid evaluation and human judgment.

Expert evaluation protocol parallels the Hybrid framework while allowing nuanced human judgment. Evaluators assess samples from all variants using comparable criteria with flexibility for qualitative feedback on optimization benefits not captured through automated assessment.

Human baseline comparison establishes benchmarks through human-generated samples for both 100 training and 50 unseen topics. This comparison assesses whether optimized models approach human-level quality while identifying optimization approach strengths and limitations.

\subsubsection{Unseen Topic Expert Validation}

Expert validation focuses on 50 unseen topics for independent verification of optimization effectiveness. Blind evaluation protocols involve fundraising professionals assessing samples from all variants without knowledge of optimization method, providing unbiased assessment of benefits.

Expert consensus analysis quantifies agreement between expert assessments and Hybrid evaluation for unseen topics. This validates that the Hybrid framework captures optimization benefits meaningful to domain experts while identifying differences between automated and human approaches.

\subsection{Three-Way Optimization Interpretation Framework and Enhanced Limitations Assessment}

The interpretation framework provides guidelines for drawing valid conclusions from three-way optimization data while acknowledging limitations and alternative explanations. Procedures include practical significance assessment, consideration of confidence intervals and effect sizes, evaluation of consistency between Hybrid and expert assessment, and identification of confounding variables.

Limitation identification addresses areas affecting generalizability while acknowledging Hybrid approach improvements: domain specificity of charity fundraising balanced against 150-topic scope, framework limitations reduced through validated Hybrid methodology, open-source model constraints, and temporal considerations enhanced by unseen topic validation.

Single-mode approach strengths enhance research validity: reduced complexity enabling focused optimization analysis, increased consistency through validated Hybrid framework, enhanced reliability through elimination of cross-mode confounding, and improved applicability through optimal evaluation approach.

Generalizability assessment examines applicability to broader email generation beyond fundraising, benefiting from unseen topic validation. Assessment considers transferability to other persuasive contexts, three-way comparison applicability to different domains, DPO effectiveness relevance for content generation, and confidence from training-to-unseen generalization.

\subsubsection{Unseen Topic Evaluation Benefits}

Unseen topic evaluation provides methodological advantages enhancing validity and applicability: genuine generalization assessment beyond training data, reduced overfitting risk, increased deployment confidence through realistic evaluation, and enhanced ecological validity. These benefits strengthen research contribution while addressing preference optimization evaluation limitations.
