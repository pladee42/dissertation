\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Multi-Agent Systems in Artificial Intelligence}

The evolution of artificial intelligence systems has increasingly shifted toward collaborative architectures where multiple specialized agents work together to accomplish complex tasks that exceed the capabilities of individual models \cite{guo2024llm_multiagent, yan2025beyond_selftalk}. This paradigmatic shift reflects a growing recognition that the challenges facing modern AI applications—particularly in natural language processing—often require diverse expertise, varied perspectives, and sophisticated coordination mechanisms that are difficult to achieve through monolithic approaches \cite{talebirad2023multiagent_collaboration, krishnan2025ai_agents}. Multi-agent systems offer unique advantages in terms of modularity, specialization, and robustness, enabling the development of AI frameworks that can adapt to complex, domain-specific requirements while maintaining interpretability and controllability \cite{ma2024agentboard, cemri2025multiagent_failure}.

Natural language generation has emerged as one of the most promising applications for multi-agent architectures, particularly in domains requiring high levels of human-like communication and contextual understanding \cite{pauli2024persuasive_language, murakami2023nlg_advertising}. The complexity of generating coherent, contextually appropriate, and stylistically consistent text across different domains and purposes has driven researchers to explore collaborative approaches where specialized agents handle distinct aspects of the generation process. Email generation represents a particularly challenging domain within natural language generation due to its requirement for personalized tone, appropriate formality levels, contextual relevance, and persuasive effectiveness—qualities that demand sophisticated understanding of both linguistic conventions and human communication preferences \cite{zhang2019email_subject, chen2019gmail_smart_compose}.

\section{Email Generation and Preference Alignment}

The challenges inherent in automated email generation extend beyond traditional text generation metrics to encompass aspects of pragmatic effectiveness, cultural sensitivity, and recipient-specific adaptation. Traditional approaches to email automation, exemplified by systems like Gmail's Smart Compose \cite{chen2019gmail_smart_compose}, have focused primarily on efficiency and basic coherence rather than sophisticated evaluation of content quality and recipient appropriateness. However, as organizations increasingly rely on automated communication systems for customer engagement, marketing campaigns, and stakeholder relations, the demand for more nuanced and effective email generation systems has grown substantially \cite{henderson2017smart_reply, li2023generative_judge}. This evolution necessitates not only improved generation capabilities but also more sophisticated evaluation methodologies that can assess multiple dimensions of email effectiveness simultaneously.

The alignment of artificial intelligence systems with human preferences has become a central concern in the development of practical AI applications, particularly those involving direct human interaction through natural language \cite{rafailov2023dpo, wang2024asft}. Traditional approaches to model alignment, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), have proven effective but suffer from computational complexity, training instability, and difficulties in scaling to diverse preference criteria. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a promising alternative that addresses many of these limitations by directly optimizing models based on preference data without requiring explicit reward model training \cite{muldrew2024active_preference, gallego2024configurable_safety}. The theoretical elegance and practical advantages of DPO have led to widespread adoption across various natural language processing tasks, yet its effectiveness within multi-agent frameworks remains largely unexplored.

\section{Evaluation Challenges in Multi-Agent Systems}

The evaluation of multi-agent systems presents unique methodological challenges that differ significantly from single-model assessment approaches \cite{yehudai2025survey_llm_agents, wang2024dynamic_evaluation}. Traditional evaluation metrics for natural language generation, such as BLEU scores or perplexity measures, fail to capture the collaborative dynamics, inter-agent communication effectiveness, and emergent behaviors that characterize multi-agent performance \cite{schmidtova2024nlg_metrics, liu2023geval}. Furthermore, the evaluation of email generation systems requires domain-specific metrics that assess not only linguistic quality but also pragmatic effectiveness, persuasive impact, and appropriateness for specific communication contexts \cite{li2023generative_judge, rony2022rome}.

Existing evaluation approaches in natural language processing suffer from several fundamental limitations that compromise their effectiveness for multi-model comparison \cite{maharana2023cococon, ni2024mixeval_x}. Cross-task inconsistency represents a major challenge, where models demonstrate varying performance patterns across different evaluation scenarios, making it difficult to establish reliable comparative assessments \cite{maharana2023cococon}. Additionally, current evaluation frameworks exhibit significant biases related to position preference, superficial reasoning cues, and inconsistent grading standards that undermine the objectivity required for systematic multi-model comparison \cite{ye2024justice_prejudice, wang2025judging_bias_lrms}. These methodological shortcomings are particularly problematic when evaluating AI systems intended for real-world deployment, where consistent and reliable performance assessment is crucial for informed decision-making \cite{ni2024mixeval_x}.

The challenge is further compounded by the lack of standardized protocols for assessing multi-agent systems, where traditional single-model evaluation metrics prove inadequate for capturing the complex interactions and emergent behaviors that characterize collaborative AI architectures \cite{li2024generation_to_judgment, xu2025contextual_judge_bench}. Contextual assessment presents additional complications, as evaluation criteria often depend on practitioner priorities and domain-specific requirements, leading to conditional evaluation frameworks that are difficult to standardize across different applications \cite{xu2025contextual_judge_bench}. The development of robust evaluation frameworks for multi-agent email generation systems thus represents a significant methodological challenge that requires careful consideration of bias mitigation, consistency enhancement, and domain-specific assessment criteria.

Recent advances in reasoning-enhanced evaluation approaches have shown promise for improving the assessment of complex AI systems by incorporating explicit reasoning steps and multi-perspective analysis \cite{marjanovic2025deepseek_thoughtology, sui2025stop_overthinking}. These approaches leverage the capacity of advanced language models to provide detailed explanations and justifications for their evaluative judgments, potentially offering more transparent and comprehensive assessment of system performance. The integration of reasoning-enhanced evaluation within multi-agent frameworks represents a natural evolution that could significantly improve the reliability and interpretability of performance assessments while providing valuable insights into system behavior and areas for improvement.

\section{Research Gaps and Methodological Limitations}

Despite substantial progress in multi-agent systems, DPO optimization, and email generation independently, the intersection of these three domains remains underexplored, revealing several critical research gaps. First, existing research has not systematically investigated how different DPO training strategies perform within multi-agent email generation frameworks, particularly when constrained by limited training data \cite{feng2024dpo_limitations, deng2025preference_data_selection}. Theoretical analyses suggest that DPO optimization may face fundamental limitations when applied to small datasets, as the method's effectiveness depends critically on the quality and quantity of preference pairs available for training \cite{feng2024dpo_limitations}. This constraint is particularly relevant for domain-specific applications like email generation, where obtaining large-scale, high-quality preference data can be prohibitively expensive or logistically challenging.

Second, the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks for multi-agent systems creates significant methodological gaps that hinder systematic comparison of different optimization approaches \cite{li2024generation_to_judgment, gu2024llm_judge_survey}. Current evaluation methodologies in the field suffer from inconsistent standards, varying protocols across different research communities, and significant biases that compromise the reliability of comparative assessments \cite{ni2024mixeval_x, gao2023automatic_assessment}. The lack of objective assessment methodologies is particularly problematic for multi-agent systems, where the complex interactions between specialized agents require sophisticated evaluation frameworks capable of capturing both individual agent performance and collective system behavior.

Third, existing approaches to preference optimization have not adequately addressed the unique challenges posed by multi-agent architectures, where the optimization of individual agents may not translate directly to improved system-level performance. The theoretical understanding of how DPO variants perform within collaborative frameworks remains limited, particularly regarding questions of convergence, stability, and the interaction effects between multiple optimized agents \cite{feng2024dpo_limitations, karthik2024scalable_ranked_preference}. This gap represents both a significant research opportunity and a practical necessity given the increasing deployment of AI systems in communication-intensive applications where reliable performance assessment is crucial.

The systematic evaluation of DPO variants within multi-agent email generation frameworks could provide crucial insights into the effectiveness of different alignment strategies and inform the development of more sophisticated automated communication systems. However, the current state of evaluation methodology presents significant obstacles to conducting such systematic comparisons, necessitating the development of novel assessment frameworks that can reliably differentiate between competing optimization approaches while maintaining objectivity and consistency across different experimental conditions.

\section{Research Approach and Methodology Innovation}

This research addresses the identified challenges through a comprehensive three-agent architecture that separates the complex task of email generation and evaluation into specialized, collaborative components. The Email Generator agent focuses exclusively on producing contextually appropriate and persuasive email content, while the Checklist Creator agent develops domain-specific evaluation criteria tailored to each communication scenario. The Judge Agent then applies these criteria systematically to assess email quality across multiple dimensions, creating a structured evaluation pipeline that reduces bias and enhances assessment consistency \cite{li2024generation_to_judgment, rony2022rome}.

The DPO optimization strategy implemented in this study systematically compares three distinct approaches to preference alignment: a Baseline variant using standard pre-trained models, a DPO-Synthetic variant trained on artificially generated preference pairs, and a DPO-Hybrid variant combining synthetic and human-curated preference data. This controlled comparison enables precise assessment of how different training data compositions affect model performance within the multi-agent framework, while maintaining consistent experimental conditions across all variants \cite{rafailov2023dpo, feng2024dpo_limitations}. The constraint of limited training data (400-425 preference pairs per variant) reflects realistic resource limitations faced by practitioners implementing such systems in specialized domains.

The evaluation methodology innovation centers on a novel Hybrid prompting strategy that integrates reasoning-enhanced assessment with traditional scoring mechanisms. This approach leverages advanced reasoning models to provide explicit justifications for evaluative decisions, thereby addressing the transparency and consistency limitations that plague existing evaluation frameworks \cite{marjanovic2025deepseek_thoughtology, xu2025contextual_judge_bench}. By incorporating structured reasoning processes into the evaluation pipeline, this methodology reduces position bias, enhances inter-rater reliability, and provides detailed insights into the factors driving system performance across different optimization conditions.

\subsection{Methodology Overview and Technical Architecture}

The three-agent architecture developed in this research implements a sophisticated division of labor that mirrors effective human collaboration in content creation and evaluation processes. The Email Generator agent, implemented using transformer-based language models ranging from 1.1B to 70B parameters, specializes in producing contextually appropriate and persuasive email content based on specific charity fundraising scenarios \cite{zhou2025ai_agent_communication, ke2025mas_zero}. This agent operates through structured prompting that incorporates recipient demographics, organizational context, and communication objectives to generate coherent, engaging email content that maintains appropriate tone and messaging effectiveness.

The Checklist Creator agent functions as a dynamic evaluation framework generator, developing domain-specific assessment criteria tailored to each unique communication scenario \cite{cheng2024exploring_llm_agents, qiao2022reasoning_prompting}. Rather than applying static evaluation rubrics, this agent analyzes the specific context of each email generation task and constructs comprehensive evaluation checklists that capture relevant quality dimensions including clarity, persuasiveness, appropriateness, and factual accuracy. This approach ensures that evaluation criteria remain contextually relevant while maintaining consistency across different topics and scenarios.

The Judge Agent serves as the systematic evaluator, applying the dynamically generated checklists to assess email quality across multiple dimensions using probability-based scoring mechanisms \cite{hadji2024inference_time_dph, xu2023re_reading_reasoning}. The reasoning model selection rationale centers on leveraging models specifically trained for analytical thinking and structured evaluation, ensuring that assessment decisions incorporate explicit reasoning steps that enhance transparency and reliability. This agent implementation reduces subjective bias through structured evaluation protocols while providing detailed justifications for scoring decisions that enable systematic analysis of performance patterns.

The validation approach employs 50 carefully selected unseen topics that span diverse charity fundraising scenarios, ensuring comprehensive evaluation across different communication contexts while maintaining experimental rigor \cite{gao2024meta_reasoning_prompting, shao2023synthetic_prompting}. This validation strategy enables robust assessment of system generalizability while providing sufficient statistical power to detect meaningful performance differences between different optimization approaches. The systematic application of this three-agent architecture across multiple model variants and optimization conditions provides unprecedented insights into multi-agent system behavior under controlled experimental conditions.

\subsection{Technical Innovation: Hybrid Prompting Strategy Development}

The development of the Hybrid prompting strategy represents a fundamental advancement in multi-agent system evaluation, addressing critical methodological limitations that have historically compromised the reliability of comparative assessments in collaborative AI systems. Traditional evaluation approaches suffer from position bias, inconsistent scoring standards, and superficial reasoning that undermines objective assessment \cite{wang2025judging_bias_lrms, ye2024justice_prejudice}. The Hybrid prompting strategy mitigates these limitations through a sophisticated integration of structured reasoning processes with probability-based scoring mechanisms that enhance both transparency and consistency.

The probability-based scoring methodology positions evaluation decisions within a statistical framework that enables systematic comparison across different model variants while maintaining objective assessment standards \cite{li2023generative_judge, liu2023geval}. Rather than relying on subjective qualitative assessments, this approach quantifies evaluation outcomes through probabilistic measures that facilitate rigorous statistical analysis. The integration of reasoning models ensures that scoring decisions incorporate explicit analytical steps, providing detailed justifications that enhance the interpretability of evaluation outcomes while enabling systematic identification of performance patterns across different optimization conditions.

The experimental design rigor implemented through this Hybrid prompting approach establishes a new standard for multi-agent system evaluation that addresses the specific challenges inherent in collaborative AI assessment \cite{chan2023chateval, chen2024meta_evaluation}. By incorporating structured reasoning processes into the evaluation pipeline, this methodology reduces the variability and bias that typically compromise multi-model comparisons. The systematic application of this evaluation framework across multiple DPO variants and diverse validation scenarios demonstrates its effectiveness in maintaining consistent assessment standards while providing detailed insights into system performance characteristics.

The technical innovation extends beyond individual component improvements to encompass a comprehensive evaluation ecosystem that supports reproducible, objective assessment of multi-agent systems under diverse experimental conditions \cite{biderman2024reproducible_evaluation, siegel2024core_bench}. This framework enables systematic investigation of optimization strategies, architectural choices, and performance trade-offs that would be difficult to assess using conventional evaluation methodologies. The establishment of this evaluation protocol represents a significant methodological contribution that facilitates more rigorous and reliable assessment of collaborative AI systems across diverse application domains.

\subsection{Model Selection Rationale and Experimental Design}

The selection of language models spanning 1.1B to 70B parameters reflects a strategic approach to comprehensive evaluation that encompasses the full spectrum of computational resources and performance characteristics available to practitioners in real-world deployment scenarios \cite{zhang2023balancing_skills, herel2023language_modeling}. This range enables systematic investigation of how model scale affects multi-agent system performance, providing crucial insights into the relationship between computational investment and collaborative effectiveness. The inclusion of both small-scale models (1.1B-1.6B parameters) and large-scale models (34B-70B parameters) facilitates analysis of performance scaling patterns and identifies optimal resource allocation strategies for different deployment contexts.

The comprehensive model range addresses a critical gap in existing multi-agent system research, where evaluations typically focus on single model architectures or limited parameter ranges that fail to capture the full spectrum of available options \cite{urlana2024llms_industrial, pimentel2024beyond_metrics}. By systematically evaluating models across this parameter range, this research provides empirical evidence for performance scaling relationships that inform practical deployment decisions. The diversity of model architectures included—ranging from efficient small-scale models like TinyLlama (1.1B) to sophisticated large-scale models like Llama-3-70B—ensures that findings remain generalizable across different computational constraints and performance requirements.

The DPO variant comparison approach implements a controlled experimental design that isolates the effects of different preference optimization strategies while maintaining consistent architectural and evaluation frameworks \cite{feng2024dpo_limitations, deng2025preference_data_selection}. The three variants—Baseline (standard pre-trained models), DPO-Synthetic (artificially generated preference pairs), and DPO-Hybrid (combining synthetic and human-curated data)—represent distinct approaches to preference alignment that reflect different resource allocation strategies available to practitioners. This systematic comparison enables precise assessment of optimization effectiveness under realistic resource constraints.

The experimental design connects directly to comprehensive evaluation objectives by ensuring that performance assessments capture the full range of system behaviors under different optimization conditions \cite{card2020statistical_power, connolly2023task_specific}. The constraint of limited training data (400-425 preference pairs per variant) reflects realistic limitations faced by organizations implementing specialized AI systems, where obtaining large-scale preference data can be prohibitively expensive or logistically challenging. This constraint enables investigation of DPO effectiveness under conditions that mirror real-world deployment scenarios, providing practical insights for system designers working within similar limitations.

The systematic evaluation across multiple model variants and optimization approaches establishes a comprehensive empirical foundation for understanding multi-agent system behavior that extends beyond specific implementation details to encompass general principles of collaborative AI system design and optimization \cite{kim2025pipa_evaluation, siegel2024core_bench}. This methodological approach ensures that research findings remain applicable across diverse application domains while providing specific guidance for practitioners implementing similar systems in resource-constrained environments.

\section{Research Implications}

The findings of this research carry significant implications for multiple dimensions of AI system development and deployment, fundamentally challenging existing paradigms in model selection, preference optimization, and evaluation methodology. The statistical equivalence demonstrated across DPO variants ($F(2,747) = 0.329$, $p = 0.720$, $\eta^2 = 0.001$) provides crucial evidence that sophisticated optimization techniques may offer diminishing returns when constrained by limited training data, fundamentally reshaping how practitioners approach resource allocation in multi-agent system development \cite{deng2025preference_data_selection, feng2024dpo_limitations}.

\subsection{Model Selection and Resource Allocation Practices}

The empirical evidence presented in this study demonstrates that architectural robustness in multi-agent systems can effectively compensate for optimization sophistication, suggesting that development resources may be more efficiently allocated toward system design and integration rather than complex preference optimization strategies \cite{ferrag2025llm_autonomous_agents, liu2024advances_foundation_agents}. This finding challenges the prevailing industry focus on increasingly sophisticated training methodologies and suggests that practitioners working with constrained datasets should prioritize collaborative architecture development over optimization complexity. The consistent performance across model scales from 1.1B to 70B parameters further indicates that smaller, more computationally efficient models may achieve comparable results within well-designed multi-agent frameworks, providing significant cost savings for deployment scenarios where computational resources are limited \cite{masterman2024landscape_emerging}.

The implications for model selection extend beyond individual system performance to encompass broader considerations of scalability, maintainability, and interpretability that are crucial for real-world deployment \cite{sapkota2025ai_agents_agentic}. Multi-agent architectures that maintain consistent performance across different model variants offer practitioners greater flexibility in adapting to changing computational constraints, regulatory requirements, and performance objectives without requiring complete system redesign. This architectural resilience represents a fundamental advantage that may prove more valuable than marginal performance improvements achieved through sophisticated optimization techniques.

\subsection{DPO Application Considerations and Training Data Constraints}

The revealed limitations of DPO effectiveness under constrained data conditions (400-425 preference pairs) provide critical guidance for practitioners considering preference optimization in specialized domains where large-scale data collection is prohibitively expensive or logistically challenging \cite{feng2024dpo_limitations, karthik2024scalable_ranked_preference}. The research demonstrates that below certain data thresholds, the complexity of DPO variants offers no measurable advantage over simpler baseline approaches, suggesting that investment in data quality and quantity may yield superior returns compared to algorithmic sophistication.

These findings have particular relevance for specialized applications in domains such as legal document generation, medical communication, technical writing, and other professional contexts where preference data is inherently scarce and expensive to obtain \cite{bernard2024equator_deterministic}. Rather than pursuing complex optimization strategies with limited data, practitioners in these domains may achieve better results by focusing on architectural improvements, better prompt engineering, and systematic evaluation frameworks that can reliably assess performance across diverse scenarios.

The research also highlights the importance of considering the interaction between training data constraints and optimization complexity in the broader context of AI system development lifecycle costs \cite{zeng2023challenge_meta_reasoning}. The computational overhead associated with complex DPO training may not justify the marginal performance improvements achievable with limited preference data, suggesting that simpler approaches may offer superior cost-effectiveness for many practical applications.

\subsection{Evaluation Framework Broader Applicability}

The novel Hybrid prompting evaluation methodology developed in this research addresses fundamental limitations in existing multi-agent system assessment approaches and demonstrates transferability across diverse collaborative AI applications \cite{lee2025evaluating_reasoning_traces, patil2025advancing_reasoning_llm}. The framework's success in overcoming traditional evaluation biases while maintaining consistency across different experimental conditions establishes a new standard for objective assessment of complex AI systems that extends well beyond email generation applications.

The methodology's emphasis on reasoning-enhanced evaluation protocols addresses critical gaps in current assessment approaches that fail to capture the collaborative dynamics essential to multi-agent system performance \cite{xu2025contextual_judge_bench}. This framework provides a foundation for systematic evaluation across domains ranging from scientific research assistance to creative content generation, automated customer service, and collaborative decision-making systems. The demonstrated reliability and objectivity of the evaluation approach offers practitioners a standardized methodology for comparing different system configurations and optimization strategies while maintaining transparency and interpretability.

The broader applicability of this evaluation framework has particular significance for advancing the field of collaborative AI systems, where traditional single-model assessment metrics prove inadequate for capturing emergent behaviors and inter-agent coordination effectiveness \cite{yehudai2025survey_llm_agents}. By providing a replicable template for objective assessment, this methodology enables more rigorous comparative studies across different research groups and application domains, facilitating the systematic accumulation of knowledge about multi-agent system design principles and optimization strategies.

\section{Research Contribution and Dissertation Overview}

This dissertation addresses these fundamental challenges by developing and evaluating a comprehensive three-agent framework for email generation that integrates state-of-the-art DPO optimization with novel evaluation methodologies designed to overcome the limitations identified in existing approaches. The primary contribution of this research is the establishment of a novel Hybrid prompting evaluation framework that successfully addresses the objectivity and consistency limitations plaguing existing multi-agent system assessment approaches, demonstrating superior reliability compared to conventional evaluation methodologies \cite{li2024generation_to_judgment, xu2025contextual_judge_bench}. 

The research investigates the comparative effectiveness of three DPO variants—Baseline, DPO-Synthetic, and DPO-Hybrid—within this structured multi-agent architecture, revealing statistically equivalent performance across all optimization strategies ($F(2,747) = 0.329$, $p = 0.720$, $\eta^2 = 0.001$) when evaluated on 50 diverse validation topics. This unexpected finding challenges conventional assumptions about DPO effectiveness in constrained data scenarios and provides crucial insights into the relationship between training data quantity and optimization sophistication. The methodological framework developed in this study offers a replicable template for evaluating multi-agent systems across diverse natural language generation domains, extending beyond email generation to encompass any application requiring collaborative AI assessment with objective, bias-resistant evaluation protocols. Through systematic evaluation using both traditional metrics and novel reasoning-enhanced approaches, this work establishes empirical foundations for understanding multi-agent system behavior under different optimization conditions and provides practical guidance for practitioners implementing similar systems in resource-constrained environments.
